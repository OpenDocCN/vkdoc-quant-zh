  zh: 摘要
- en: 'The phrase “Great Reset” is now in the public domain and appears in a number
    of analyses and discussions. However, we often remain ambiguous in this regard.
    It may be helpful to read the World Economic Forum''s so-called white paper, Resetting
    the Future of Work Agenda in a Post-Covid World, to understand what theorists
    of this epochal maneuver are aiming for. This 31-page document describes how to
    run (or, as they say these days, implement) the software included in the CoViD-19
    book. World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab and Thierry Malleret co-wrote
    The Great Reset (Schwab and Malleret in COVID-19: The Big Reset, [2020](#CR1);
    Umbrello in The Journal Value Inquiry:1–8, [2021](#CR2); Roth in European Management
    Journal 39.5:538–544, [2021](#CR3)). Why devote an entire chapter to this topic
    in a book about AI and its applications in finance? It’s simple: updating the
    financial world to make it safer, more understandable, and more manageable necessitates
    extensive use of AI technologies. These technologies can be harmful up to a point.'

  zh: “大重置”一词现已进入公共领域，并出现在许多分析和讨论中。然而，我们在这方面经常保持模糊。阅读世界经济论坛的所谓白皮书《在后疫情世界中重置未来工作议程》可能会有所帮助，以了解这一时代性举措的理论家们的目标。这份31页的文件描述了如何运行（或者，如今他们所说的，实施）包含在
    CoViD-19 书籍中的软件。世界经济论坛创始人克劳斯·施瓦布和蒂埃里·马勒雷共同撰写了《大重置》（Schwab and Malleret在《COVID-19：大重置》中，[2020](#CR1)；Umbrello在《价值探讨期刊》中：1-8，[2021](#CR2)；Roth在《欧洲管理期刊》39.5：538-544，[2021](#CR3)）。为什么在一本关于人工智能及其在金融中的应用的书中要专门致力于这个话题一个完整的章节？答案很简单：为了更新金融世界，使其更安全、更可理解和更可控制，需要广泛使用人工智能技术。这些技术在某种程度上可能是有害的。

    social separation, approximately 83% of people will be required to work remotely,
    with no human interaction. At least half of all activities are expected to be
    automated, implying that direct human input, even in the same remote activity,
    will be drastically reduced, and upskilling and reskilling activities will also
    need to be computerized. Upskilling is the acquisition of new skills that allow
    a person to become more effective and qualified in their field. The acquisition
    of significantly different abilities in order for a person to perform a different
    function is referred to as reskilling. In other words, the imperative in this
    scenario is to avoid human touch and achieve everything through computers, artificial
    intelligence, and algorithms.

    steer the market toward more equitable outcomes. Governments should improve coordination
    (for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy), upgrade trade agreements,
    and create the conditions for a “stakeholder economy” to achieve this goal. Governments
    have a strong incentive to pursue such action in an era of shrinking tax bases

  zh: 大重置议程将包括三个主要组成部分。第一个是引导市场走向更加公平的结果。政府应该提高协调能力（例如，在税收、监管和财政政策方面），升级贸易协定，并创造实现这一目标的“利益相关者经济”的条件。在税基萎缩和公共债务飙升的时代，政府有强烈的动机采取这样的行动。
- en: Furthermore, governments should carry out long-overdue reforms that promote
    more equitable outcomes. These may include changes to wealth taxes, the elimination
    of fossil-fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade,
    and competition, depending on the country.

  zh: 此外，政府应该进行长期拖延的改革，促进更公平的结果。这些可能包括改变财富税、消除化石燃料补贴以及根据国家情况制定新的知识产权、贸易和竞争规则。
- en: The second component of a Great Reset agenda would be to ensure that investments
    advance common goals like equality and sustainability. The large-scale spending
    programs that many governments are implementing represent a significant opportunity
    for progress in this area. The European Commission, for example, has proposed
    a €750 billion ($826 billion) recovery fund. The United States, China, and Japan
    all have aggressive economic stimulus plans.

- en: Instead of using these funds, as well as investments from private entities and
    pension funds, to patch up the old system, we should use them to build a new one
    that is more resilient, equitable, and long-term sustainable. This includes, for
    example, the construction of “green” urban infrastructure and the creation of
    incentives for industries to improve their performance on environmental, social,

- en: The third and final priority of a Great Reset agenda is to use Fourth Industrial
    Revolution innovations to benefit the public good, particularly by addressing
    health and social challenges. Companies, universities, and others banded together
    during the COVID-19 crisis to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and possible
    vaccines; establish testing centers; develop mechanisms for tracing infections;

    short, a return to business as usual. This will not occur because it cannot occur.
    In most cases, “business as usual” has died (or been infected with) COVID-19\.
    Economic hibernation caused by blockades and social distancing measures has devastated
    some sectors. Others will struggle to recoup lost revenue before embarking on
    an increasingly narrow path to profitability as a result of the global economic

- en: The buzzword of “digital transformation” was the mantra of most executive boards
    and committees prior to the pandemic. Digital was “critical,” it had to be implemented
    “decisively,” and it was regarded as a “prerequisite for success”! Since then,
    the mantra has become a must, even in the case of some businesses, a matter of
    life and death. This is simple to explain and comprehend. During our incarceration,
    we were completely reliant on the Internet for everything, from work and education
    to socializing. It is online services that have allowed us to maintain a semblance
    of normalcy, and it is natural that “online” has benefited the most from the pandemic,
    providing a huge boost to technologies and processes that allow us to do things
    remotely, such as universal Internet to broadband, mobile and remote payments,
    and viable e-government services, among others. As a result, businesses that already
    operate online will have a long-term competitive advantage. Businesses in industries
    as diverse as e-commerce, contactless operations, digital content, robots, and
    drone deliveries (to name a few) will thrive as more and more things and services

  zh: “数字转型”这个流行词在大流行之前是大多数执行委员会和委员会的口头禅。数字是“至关重要的”，必须“果断”实施，并被视为“成功的前提”！从那时起，这个口头禅已经成为一种必须，甚至在一些企业的情况下，成为生死攸关的问题。这很容易解释和理解。在我们被监禁期间，我们完全依赖互联网进行一切，从工作和教育到社交。正是在线服务让我们保持了一种正常的状态，自然，“在线”是从大流行中受益最多的，为我们提供了一个巨大的推动力，这些技术和流程使我们能够远程完成各种事务，如通用互联网到宽带、移动和远程支付以及可行的电子政务服务等。因此，已经在线运营的企业将拥有长期的竞争优势。像电子商务、无接触运营、数字内容、机器人和无人机交付等行业的企业将随着越来越多的事物和服务通过我们的手机和电脑送到我们手中而蓬勃发展。阿里巴巴、亚马逊、Netflix和Zoom等公司之所以成为封锁的“赢家”，并非偶然。

    required contactless experience imposed on many food and retail businesses during
    lockdowns to virtual showrooms in the manufacturing industry that allow customers
    to browse and select the products they prefer, most business-to-consumer companies
    have quickly recognized the need to provide their customers with a digital journey
    “from start to finish.”

    of these different activities, such as equipment maintenance, inventory management,
    supplier relationships, and security strategies, can now be performed (to a large

- en: Because of the inherent fragility of global supply chains, discussions about
    shortening have been ongoing for years. They are often intricate and difficult
    to manage. They are also difficult to monitor in terms of environmental and labor
    law compliance, potentially exposing companies to reputational risks and brand
    damage. In light of this troubled history, the pandemic has put the final nail
    in the coffin of the principle that companies should optimize supply chains based
    on the cost of individual components and on a single source of supply for critical
    materials. In the post-pandemic era, “end-to-end value optimization”—a concept
    that includes resilience, efficiency, and cost—will be dominant. The formula states
    that “just-in-case” will eventually replace “just-in-time.”

  zh: 由于全球供应链固有的脆弱性，关于缩短的讨论已经进行了多年。它们通常是错综复杂且难以管理的。它们在环境和劳工法合规方面的监督也很困难，这可能会使公司面临声誉风险和品牌损害。鉴于这段动荡的历史，大流行已经为公司应该根据单个组件的成本以及关键材料的单一供应来源来优化供应链的原则敲定了最后一击。在后大流行时代，“端到端价值优化”——包括弹性、效率和成本的概念将占主导地位。该公式指出，“万一”最终将取代“及时”。
- en: The shocks to global supply chains discussed in the macro section will affect
    both large and small businesses. But, in practice, what does “just in case” mean?
    The globalization model conceived and built at the end of the last century by
    global manufacturing companies in search of low-cost labor, products, and components
    has reached its limits. It has fragmented international production into ever more
    intricate fragments, resulting in a system managed on an intimate scale that has
    proven extremely lean and efficient, but also extremely complex and, as a result,
    extremely vulnerable (complexity brings fragility and often provokes instability).
    As a result, simplification is the antidote, which should result in increased
    resilience. As a result, the “global value chains,” which account for roughly
    three-quarters of all global trade, will inevitably decline. This decline will
    be exacerbated by the new reality that companies that rely on complex just-in-time
    supply chains can no longer assume that the World Trade Organization's tariff
    commitments will protect them from a sudden wave of protectionism from somewhere
    part.

  zh: 宏观部分讨论的对全球供应链的冲击将影响大大小小的企业。但在实践中，“万一”意味着什么呢？上世纪末由全球制造公司构想并建立的全球化模式，以寻找低成本劳动力、产品和零部件为目的，已经达到了极限。它将国际生产分解为越来越复杂的碎片，导致了一个在亲密规模上运作的系统，这个系统被证明是极其精益和高效的，但也极其复杂，因此也极其脆弱（复杂性带来脆弱性，通常会引发不稳定性）。因此，简化是解毒剂，这应该会增加弹性。结果，占全球贸易约四分之三的“全球价值链”将不可避免地下降。这种下降将被新现实加剧，即依赖复杂的及时供应链的公司不能再假设世界贸易组织的关税承诺会保护它们免受来自某个地方的突然保护主义浪潮的影响。
- en: 'As a result, they will be forced to prepare for a prolonged outage by reducing
    or localizing their supply chain and devising alternative production or supply
    plans. Any business whose profitability is dependent on the just-in-time global
    supply chain principle will have to rethink how it operates and will almost certainly
    have to sacrifice the idea of maximizing efficiency and profits for the sake of
    “supply security” and resilience. Resilience will then become the primary consideration
    for any business serious about protecting itself from disruption, whether that
    disruption is caused by a specific supplier, a potential change in trade policy,
    or a specific country or region. In practice, this will force businesses to diversify
    their supplier base, even at the expense of stockpiling and creating redundancy.
    It will also compel these companies to ensure that the same is true within their
    own supply chain: they will assess resilience throughout the entire supply chain,
    all the way down to their final supplier and possibly even their supplier’s suppliers.
    Costs of production will inevitably rise, but this will be the cost of building
    resilience. At first glance, the automotive, electronics, and industrial machinery
    sectors will be the most affected because they will be the first to change production
    models.'

  zh: 因此，它们将被迫通过减少或本地化他们的供应链，并制定替代性的生产或供应计划来准备长期停产。任何盈利依赖于及时全球供应链原则的企业都将不得不重新考虑其运营方式，并几乎可以肯定地牺牲最大化效率和利润的想法，以换取“供应安全”和弹性。弹性随后将成为任何认真保护自身免受干扰的企业的主要考虑因素，无论这种干扰是由特定供应商、贸易政策的潜在变化，还是特定国家或地区引起的。在实践中，这将迫使企业扩大其供应商基础，即使这意味着囤积和创建冗余也要付出代价。这也将迫使这些公司确保同样的情况在他们自己的供应链中也成立：他们将评估整个供应链的弹性，一直到最终供应商，甚至可能是供应商的供应商。生产成本将不可避免地上升，但这将是建立弹性的成本。乍一看，汽车、电子和工业机械行业将受到最大影响，因为它们将是首批改变生产模式的企业。
