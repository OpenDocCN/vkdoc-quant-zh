- en: 'The 2020 global stock market crash triggered by the coronavirus outbreak has
    led to an intertwined and still unfolding series of social, economic, and financial
    consequences. We will review several aspects of the recent pandemic crisis and
    critically compare them to extant findings on the effects of financial breaks,
    fear, and turbulences (global financial crises, terrorism, and previous pandemics)
    on financial markets. With the increase of uncertainty and volatility, the Covid-19
    pandemic also affected investors’ risk attitudes, trust, and confidence. We will
    provide insight into these behavioral aspects and how they ultimately affect financial
    decision-making. Moreover, a unique side effect of the government restrictions
    is the unprecedented increase of digitalization: never before have global citizen
    of all ages been cornered into using online services and digital tools. We will
    discuss the implications of this new phenomenon for the financial market, its
    effect on social inequality, and the scenario of opportunities it entails.'

  zh: 3.1 引言
- en: In late 2019, Covid-19 had started to spread. Due to severe pneumonia, the virus
    led to an extraordinary rate of death between the elderly and the most vulnerable
    in society, leading to an international social distancing and home isolation of
    more than 2 billion people worldwide, with tremendous social, political, and economic
    consequences (Goodell [2020](#CR32); Sharif et al. [2020](#CR50)). Moreover, one
    of the commercial effects of this virus was an unexpected disruption in the flow
    of goods and services, commodity prices and financial conditions, creating economic
    disasters across many countries because of its impact on the production and supply
    chains in China, the United States, Europe, and Japan, and other important economies
    in the world (IMF [2020](#CR35)).

  zh: 2019年末，Covid-19开始蔓延。由于严重的肺炎，病毒导致老年人和社会中最脆弱的人之间的死亡率异常高，引发了全球超过20亿人的国际社交距离和居家隔离，带来了巨大的社会、政治和经济后果（Goodell
    [2020](#CR32)；Sharif et al. [2020](#CR50)）。此外，这种病毒的商业影响之一是对商品和服务流动、商品价格和金融状况的意外干扰，由于对中国、美国、欧洲、日本和世界其他重要经济体的生产和供应链造成了影响，引发了许多国家的经济灾难（IMF
    [2020](#CR35)）。
- en: The outbreak of Covid-19 was a shock to market participants (Ramelli and Wagner
    [2020](#CR48)) and the anticipated real effects of the health crisis were amplified
    through financial channels. In contrast to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007,
    Covid-19 primarily was a shock to the real economy, initially unrelated to the
    availability of external financial means though the market’s reaction anticipated
    a potential amplification of the real shock through financial restrictions.

- en: Analyzing the impact of this unanticipated rare disaster on financial markets,
    we can outline three phases in the progression of the pandemic.^([1](#Fn1)) On
    December 31, 2019, cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan, China, were first reported
    to the World Health Organization (WHO), and on January 1, 2020, Chinese health
    authorities closed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market after it was discovered
    that the wild animals sold there may be the source of the virus (World Health
    Organization [2020](#CR55)a). The first trading day was January 2, hence the starting
    point of the first period.

  zh: 分析这场意外罕见灾难对金融市场的影响，我们可以概括出疫情进展的三个阶段。[^1] 2019年12月31日，中国武汉发现的肺炎病例首次向世界卫生组织报告，2020年1月1日，中国卫生部门关闭了华南海鲜批发市场，因为发现那里销售的野生动物可能是病毒的来源（世界卫生组织[2020](#CR55)a）。第一个交易日是1月2日，因此第一个时期的起点。
- en: Second, on January 20, Chinese health authorities confirmed human-to-human transmission
    of the coronavirus, and the following day the WHO issued the first situation report
    on the outbreak (China’s National Health Commission [2020](#CR21); World Health
    Organization [2020](#CR56)b). Monday, January 20 was a national holiday in the
    United States; therefore the following day marked the beginning of the second
    phase.

- en: Third, on Sunday, February 23, Italy placed almost 50,000 people under strict
    lockdown in an attempt to control the outbreak after registering its first deaths
    from coronavirus on Saturday, February 22 (Italy’s Council of Ministers [2020](#CR36)).
    February 24 was the first trading day in this phase and the situation plummeted
    in the following weeks. On Monday, March 9 the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
    fell 2014 points, a 7.79% drop. Two days later, on March 11, the World Health
    Organization classified Covid-19 as a pandemic. On March 12, 2020, the DJIA fell
    2352 points to close at 21,200\. It was a 9.99% drop and the sixth-worst percentage
    decrease in history. Finally, on March 16, the DJIA collapsed by nearly 3000 points
    to close at 20,188, losing 12.9%. The fall in stock prices forced the New York
    Stock Exchange to suspend trading several times during those days.

- en: In March 2020, the world witnessed one of the most dramatic stock market crashes
    so far. In barely four trading days, the DJIA plunged 6400 points, an equivalent
    of roughly 26%. The sharp fall in stock market prices was caused by the authorities’
    decision to impose strict quarantines on the population and ordered a lockdown
    of most business activities to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Lockdowns
    imposed to business activities put on hold most of the business operations, and
    companies reacted by adjusting their labor costs to compensate the revenue shock.
    The layoff of employees led to a sharp reduction in consumption and economic output,
    lowering companies’ stream of expected future cash flows.

  zh: 在2020年3月，世界目睹了迄今为止最引人注目的股市崩盘之一。在仅仅四个交易日内，道琼斯指数暴跌6400点，相当于大约26%。股市价格的急剧下跌是由于当局决定对人口实施严格的隔离措施，并下令对大多数商业活动实施封锁，以限制新冠病毒的传播。对商业活动实施的封锁暂停了大部分的业务运作，公司对此做出反应，通过调整劳动力成本来弥补收入冲击。裁员导致消费和经济产出急剧减少，降低了公司未来预期现金流的流动性。

    Some sectors, in fact, have benefitted from the pandemic and the resulting lockdowns.
    Mazur et al. [2021](#CR44) focused on S&P 1500 and found that firms that operate
    in crude petroleum sector were hit hardest and lost over 60% of their market values
    in a day. In contrast, firms in natural gas and chemicals sectors improved their
    market valuations and earned positive returns of more than 10%, on average. Further,
    they study industry-level patterns and show that during March 2020 stock market
    crash, the best-performing industries include healthcare, food, software, and

- en: If it’s unsurprising that Covid-19 captured the attention of the financial markets,
    it is interesting to note when market participants became more preoccupied with
    the development of the situation. One measure used in research to gauge retail
    investor interest in a topic was developed by Da et al. [2015](#CR25) and it uses
    the intensity of search on Google. Ramelli and Wagner [2020](#CR48) exploit Google
    Trends search to capture investor sentiment and show that Global Google search
    attention on coronavirus spiked, especially after March 9, while the number of
    conference calls of international firms and the number of conference calls covering
    the coronavirus topic also increased, but spiked earlier on at the end of February.
    In their study, they find that initially, as China was effectively shut down,
    investors avoided U.S. stocks with China exposure and internationally oriented
    companies; as the virus situation in China improved relative to the situation
    in Europe and in the United States, investors perceived those companies more favorably
    again. As the virus spread in Europe and the United States, leading to lockdowns
    in these economies, markets moved feverishly.

    virus, with different speed and stringency. These included school, theater, and
    church closures, public gathering bans, quarantine of suspected cases, and restricted
    business hours. Their results show no evidence that cities that enacted more stringent

- en: In the aftermath of the SARS outbreak, studies like (Beutels et al. [2009](#CR13);
    Sadique et al. [2007](#CR49); Smith [2006](#CR54)) highlighted the economic implications
    of pandemics. Outbreaks like SARS are predicted to generate immediate direct economic
    effects from the impact of the disease itself (health sector costs related to
    treatment of those infected), from policies to contain disease (public sector
    and private costs related to quarantine, isolation and school closure) and from
    the fear that is generated by the outbreak, which will affect individual behavior.
    The presence of a health threat can influence the general expectations and behavior
    of consumers and investors and, therefore, have an impact far beyond the direct
    reduction in productivity from sick patients (Sadique et al. [2007](#CR49)). For
    instance, for SARS, it has been observed that by far the largest economic impact
    occurred by reduced local and international travel and reduced engagement in non-vital
    consumption activities such as restaurants and bars, particularly in May 2003,
    as well as postponement of consumption of mostly durable goods (Richard et al.
    [2008](#CR42)). Beutels et al. [2009](#CR13) underline the importance of acknowledging
    consumers and investors adaptation to public health emergencies to provide useful
    economic analysis in the context of pandemics.

    quarterly macroeconomic model of the UK economy. They used the latter two pandemics

    a recurrence of the Spanish flu would be very different in the current economy.
    However, by using the more recent pandemics as a base case for disease scenarios
    and extrapolating beyond the severity of more serious pandemics, such as 1918,
    they are able to generate some useful hypotheses and stimulate thinking on the

    95% of the world’s GDP to assess whether the stock market crash in 2020 was driven
    by rational expectations^([5](#Fn5)) or an increased attention to news. Similarly

    Google search volume within the assessed time frame. The authors find that one
    standard deviation increase in news attention leads to a 0.279 standard deviation
    decrease in market returns, whereas one standard deviation increase in the authors’
    rational expectations measure leads to a decrease of 0.131 standard deviations
    of market returns. The cost for the US stock market associated to the hype of
    negative news was estimated to be USD 3.5 trillion until April 2020\. Also (Al-Awadhi

    level of uncertainty avoidance. The higher the tendency of trying to mitigate
    uncertain situations, the higher the search volume for additional information.
    The results are in line with previous reports: national culture, in association
    with the uncertainty avoidance index, is a significant predictor of stock market
    returns in times of crises, in that cultures who are more risk and uncertainty
    averse tend to seek for more information, ultimately increasing their level of
    anxiety which in turn has negative effects on stock market outcomes. Similarly,
    also (Bernhofer et al. [2021](#CR12)) show that speakers of languages defined
    by a more intensive use of non-indicative (*irrealis*) moods have a higher level
    of risk aversion and invest less in risky assets. This is due to the fact that,

- en: The idea that people are affected by their emotions when making financial decisions
    was first described by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 in his prominent publication
    *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.* In what most likely represents
    the origin of behavioral finance, he illustrates how “animal spirits”, or basic
    instincts and emotions, affect consumer confidence. In what was observed by Hippocrates
    from Kos in 400 B.C. and Claudius Galen from Pergamon in 200 A.D. as *pneuma psychikon*
    (or “animal spirits”), an invisible entity located within the cerebral ventricles
    and which moves through muscles and nerves (Herbowski [2013](#CR33); Smith et
    al. [2012](#CR53)). This approximation however appears to be indeed the original
    idea of the biological explanation behind the psychological reaction to crises
    and uncertainty as a “spontaneous urge to action”. One of the reactions to shocks
    hence appears to lie in the production of the “stress hormone”, cortisol, which
    increases as a response to e.g. market volatility and has been shown to decrease
    risk propensity (Kandasamy et al. [2014](#CR38)). Also measured anxiety and its
    consequences on financial decision-making can be, at least in part, explained
    by the surge of cortisol levels as small probabilities tend to be overweighted
    as a response to increased levels of stress. The latter phenomenon is more commonly
    observed in men compared to women.

    decision-making from a slightly different angle by investigating a society’s pre-existing
    inherent level of trust and its resilience against the effects of the pandemic.
    The authors analyze data from the World Value Survey covering 47 countries and
    the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases from the end of January to the end of July
    2020\. Trust was measured with two different indices, societal trust—or trust
    in other people—and confidence in the government. Market Volatility was calculated
    as the 5-day moving average volatility and Covid-19 cases were adjusted by population
    size. Stock markets were found to be significantly less affected by new Covid-19
    case reports in those countries where societal trust and confidence in the government
    were higher. The authors hypothesize that the transmission mechanism passes through
    the level of uncertainty which is lowered by the confidence in the government’s
    rules as well as the level of trust in fellow citizens obeying new rules and prescriptions.
    The role of an active government in building trust and mediating emotional responses,
    or “animal spirits”, to crises was underlined by Akerlof and Shiller [2010](#CR3).
    It should therefore act as a responsible parent to the economy, mitigating its
    reactions to critical events.

    proof of creditworthiness and without financial resources, a significant share

    The most affected share of the population is represented by citizen with low income,
    women, and ethnic minorities. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to overcome
    these limitations as potential recipients can be evaluated in different domains:
    the creditworthiness of an individual is therefore not limited to their financial
    history but could extend, for example, to their social network activity and behavior,
    geographical location, and online purchases. Under the condition that equal access
    to digital technology is granted, the recent developments allow for a worldwide
    inclusion into financial, educational, and commercial realities of disadvantaged
    and geographically remote populations. In Bangladesh for example, iFarmer is a
    crowdfunding platform that puts together female cattle farmers targeting potential
    investors. Digital lending has experienced a significant increase with the onset
    of the pandemic with the special form of Fintech, P2P (peer-to-peer) lending over
    apps, becoming more frequently an alternative to banks or other financial intermediaries
    (Arninda and Prasetyani [2022](#CR8)). Loans in such platforms are transferred
    from individual to individual, cutting bureaucracy and costs in a substantial
    way. Crowdfunding and P2P lending have already existed before the pandemic (Agur
    et al. [2020](#CR1); Lin et al. [2017](#CR43)), but the level of digital literacy
    acquired opens up for an unprecedented number of opportunities for targeted policy
    interventions aimed at putting together philanthropists with who was left behind
    during the last two years and small start-up projects with potential, but with
    little traditional creditworthiness with small venture capitalists without geographical

  zh: 社会联系是向上社会流动的已知预测因素，并且可能促成新的全球互联，这也可以被那些以前局限于常常有限的本地机会的人所利用。Chetty等人[2022a](#CR19)，[2022b](#CR20)研究了基于社交媒体友谊和邮政编码的三种连接方式。第一种是低社会经济地位和高社会经济地位之间的连接，第二种类型是社会凝聚力，第三种是定义的公民参与水平。他们发现第一种（经济）连接是向上收入流动的最强因素。我们声称，这在某种程度上也适用于全球互联，无论物理距离如何。
- en: The present century is the century of complexity, as already predicted by a
    famous physicist and as we have seen, financial markets are no exception. The
    development of the concept of resilience is a consequence of this prophecy, as
    complexity cannot be solved with one pill. Recovering from the unforeseen—financially
    and socially—is however possible, with the right tools at hand. By increasing
    financial and digital literacy, investing in education and granting access to
    technology and by building up confidence in peers and in the government, a more
    equitable world can be created. Finally, the idea of *stakeholder capitalism*
    with companies acting with the common good in mind instead of immediate profits,
    together with the creation of a resilient, egalitarian, and environmentally sustainable
    system are the main pillars of *The Great Reset*, an initiative promoted by the
    World Economic Forum, which will be presented more indepth in the next chapter.

  zh: 当前世纪是复杂性的世纪，正如一位著名物理学家已经预言的那样，而我们已经看到，金融市场也不例外。弹性概念的发展是这一预言的结果，因为复杂性无法用一颗药丸解决。然而，通过增加金融和数字素养，投资于教育，提供技术接入，并通过建立对同行和政府的信心，可以实现从未预料到的情况中恢复——无论是在金融还是社会上。一个更加公平的世界可以通过增强同行和政府的信心、投资于教育以及提供技术接入来创建。最后，*利益相关者资本主义*的理念，即公司以共同利益为考量而不是眼前利润行事，以及创建一个具有韧性、平等和环境可持续性的系统是*大重启*的主要支柱，这是世界经济论坛推动的一个倡议，将在下一章中更深入地介绍。
