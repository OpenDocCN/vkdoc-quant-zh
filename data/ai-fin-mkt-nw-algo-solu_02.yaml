    and integrated into a wide variety of software or systems for different and heterogenous
    application domains. AI is definitively and progressively emerging as transversal
    and powerful technological paradigm, due to its ability not only to deal with
    big data and information, but especially because it produces, manages and exploits
    knowledge. Researchers and scientists are starting to explore, from several perspectives,
    the different and synergetic ways AI will transform heterogenous business models

    *abstracting* and *reasoning*. These cognitive capabilities are not equally distributed

    initial stages of the design, development and evaluation of AI systems are not
    actually new in the history. The official birth of the discipline dates back to
    1956, when Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy hosted the Dartmouth Summer Research
    Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI) at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.
    The Dartmouth conference involved some of the main and most important historical
    “fathers” of AI, including Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, Nathaniel Rochester and
    Claude Shannon. The primary aim of the Dartmouth event was to create a totally
    new research area focused on the challenge of designing and building intelligent
    machines. The subsequent proposal (McCarthy et al. [2006](#CR25)) set the foundations
    for the analytical study of intelligence in computers and for identifying the
    first basic concepts for applying relevant methodologies, e.g. information theory,
    to the study of AI.

  zh: 尽管人工智能在当前技术场景中扮演着基本的角色，但人工智能系统的设计、开发和评估的初期阶段实际上在历史上并不是新鲜事物。该学科的正式诞生可以追溯到1956年，当时
    Marvin Minsky 和 John McCarthy 在新罕布什尔州达特茅斯学院举办了达特茅斯人工智能暑期研究项目（DSRPAI）。达特茅斯会议涉及了一些主要的和最重要的历史上的人工智能“奠基人”，包括
    Allen Newell、Herbert Simon、Nathaniel Rochester 和 Claude Shannon。达特茅斯活动的主要目的是创建一个完全新的研究领域，重点研究设计和构建智能机器的挑战。随后的提案（McCarthy
    等人 [2006](#CR25)）为在计算机中对智能进行分析研究奠定了基础，并确定了应用相关方法学的第一个基本概念，例如信息理论，用于研究人工智能。
- en: Nevertheless, the subsequent stages in the development of the discipline were
    not as easy as the founding fathers supposed. Despite the further creation of
    the first algorithms and computer programs, the Minsky’s optimistic claim that
    AI would have soon been able to resemble and emulate human intelligence was not
    proven, notwithstanding the efforts in that period of feverish activities. Some
    examples of the results of such years include ELIZA (Weizenbaum [1966](#CR36)),
    a natural language processing tool somehow anticipating the modern chatbots, and
    the General Problem Solver (Newell et al. [1959](#CR27)), a logic-based program,
    with the aspiration to create a universal problem solver, but actually able to
    solve specific classes of circumscribed problems. The basic approaches exploited
    in that period mostly relied on logic and explicit knowledge representation, in
    a totally *symbolic* perspective, with the aim to deal with empirical and psychological
    data by the means of deductive and linear *if–then* logical paths. Overall, the
    ambition of the first stages of AI was to quickly and strongly give rise of the
    so-called *strong AI*, or *Artificial General Intelligence*, namely AI systems
    totally able to emulate and even substitute the human, natural intelligence. Though,
    the application of the chosen purely-logical approaches gave rise to intrinsically
    limited methods, exploiting what DARPA peculiarly called *handcrafted knowledge*
    (Launchbury [2017](#CR21)) enabled reasoning capacities for just narrowly selected
    and pre-defined set of limited problems. Such systems were not endowed with any
    learning or abstracting capability, thus they did not meet the ambitious expectations
    of the founding fathers of the discipline.

    ELIZA（Weizenbaum [1966](#CR36)），这是一种自然语言处理工具，某种程度上预示了现代聊天机器人的出现，以及通用问题解决器（Newell
    等人 [1959](#CR27)），这是一个基于逻辑的程序，旨在创建一个通用问题解决器，但实际上只能解决特定类别的有限问题。在那个时期采用的基本方法主要依赖于逻辑和显式知识表示，完全采用*符号*视角，旨在通过演绎和线性的*if–then*逻辑路径处理经验和心理数据。总体而言，人工智能的最初阶段的野心是迅速而有力地催生所谓的*强人工智能*，或*人工通用智能*，即完全能够模仿甚至取代人类自然智能的人工智能系统。然而，选择纯逻辑方法的应用导致了固有的有限方法，利用
    DARPA 特别称为*手工制作的知识*（Launchbury [2017](#CR21)）仅为狭义选择和预定义的一组有限问题提供了推理能力。这些系统没有任何学习或抽象能力，因此未能满足学科的创始人们的雄心勃勃的期望。

    optimistic wave and conceptual blossoming of AI. In the 70’s, the US Congress

    James Lighthill published the so-called *Lighthill report* (James et al. [1973](#CR17)),
    commissioned by the British Science Research Council, after a long discussion
    within universities and scholars: this report definitively started a hard period
    for AI, where the optimistic outlook given by the previous AI researchers was
    abandoned. The Lightill report collected the major reasons for disappointment,
    including the limited capabilities of the AI systems to solve real-world problems
    in generalized settings, though the obtained results into the simulation of circumscribed
    psychological processes were promising. As a result, the research in the AI field

    Lighthill报告收集了失望的主要原因，包括人工智能系统在解决泛化设置中的真实世界问题方面的能力有限，尽管在模拟有限心理过程时取得了令人鼓舞的结果。结果，人工智能领域的研究部分被放弃，多个支持基金被终止。
- en: Nevertheless, the advent of connectionism (McLeod et al. [1998](#CR26)) in 1986
    marked a renewed period of flourishing interest and activity in AI, from a different
    and somehow opposite perspective. Aside from any ambition to replace human intelligence,
    the goal of the connectionist approach and philosophy was to study the mental
    models and the related cognitive and behavioral phenomena as emergent processes
    deriving from the working actions and interactions of interconnected neural units.
    Such conceptual shift towards the brain mechanisms somehow anticipated the further
    neuroscience involvement in AI, as well as the synergy and relationships between
    AI and *complex systems theory* (San Miguel et al. [2012](#CR30)), where brain
    and neural systems are actually prominent examples and case studies. The rise
    of connectionism started the fundamental period of study and design of *artificial
    neural networks*, trying to resemble the cognitive mechanisms on brain, while
    basically assuming that knowledge strongly derives from the interaction between
    the neural system and the outer environment. Even if the foundations of machine
    learning rooted back to the work by Donald Hebb in the 1940s, with the so-called
    *Hebbian Learning* theory (Wang and Raj [2017](#CR35)), the most significant pillars
    for its creation and initial development were stimulated by researchers like Marvin
    Minksy, James McClelland, David Rumelhart and Frank Rosenblatt, who conceived
    the *perceptron* (Rosenblatt [1958](#CR28)), namely the first model of neural
    network, thus proposing a basic method for the further studies in the *back-propagation*

  zh: 2.3 人工智能对社会的影响
- en: 'Overall, the impact of AI on society is profoundly deep and inherently multifaceted.
    Despite its still limited “intelligence”, as compared to the human one as a whole,
    the main power of AI stems from its capability to be applied to potentially every
    application field. AI represent a real quantum leap respect to other technologies,
    due to its pervasive, disruptive and technological empowering structure: it has
    been described as an *enabling technology* (Lee et al. [2019](#CR22); Lyu [2020](#CR23)),
    empowering the other technologies by its ability to produce, manage and enrich
    knowledge. These structural pillars make AI something “big” and “more” than just
    a circumscribed and mere technological artifact. AI is known to be a technological
    and methodological paradigm for the evolution of both technology itself and organization.
    Thus, given the widespread set of applications, affecting our world in many situations
    and contexts, as well as the growing interactions between AI and humans, it is
    worth to highlight how the impact of AI in society is not marginal, rather it
    has the potentialities to radically transform society in a *socio-technical* and
    *socio-AI* systemic perspective.'

  zh: 总的来说，人工智能对社会的影响深远而本质上多面。尽管与整体人类智慧相比，其“智力”仍然有限，但人工智能的主要力量源于其能够应用于潜在的每一个应用领域。人工智能代表了与其他技术相比的真正飞跃，由于其普遍、颠覆性和技术赋能结构：它被描述为一种*使能技术*（Lee
    等人 [2019](#CR22)；Lyu [2020](#CR23)），通过其生产、管理和丰富知识的能力来赋能其他技术。这些结构支柱使人工智能成为不仅仅是一个局限的和单纯的技术工件的“大”和“更多”的东西。人工智能被认为是技术和方法论的范式，用于技术自身和组织的演变。因此，考虑到其广泛的应用范围，影响我们世界的许多情况和背景，以及人工智能与人类之间不断增长的互动，值得强调的是，人工智能对社会的影响并不边缘，而是有可能在*社会技术*和*社会-人工智能*系统视角下彻底改变社会的潜力。
- en: 'This process is still happening, giving rise to significant and unavoidable
    ethical issues. In spite of the powerful nature of AI, humans cannot escape the
    need to definitively decide whether they mean to manage it as a tool—rather, an
    impressive methodological and technological paradigm –, namely as a means to an
    end, or somehow as the end in itself. In another related perspective, the ethical
    challenges have always root in the human choice about how they aim to design AI
    and how they intend to exploit the potentialities, capabilities and structural
    applications of AI. This choice definitively reflects the human free will: thus,
    it is certainly a fundamental crossroad that only human intelligence and nature
    can pass. Nevertheless, the examination of the many and relevant ethical implications
    of AI in society is not the focus of this chapter.'

    and evolving: suffice it to consider that, according to the International Data
    Corporation (IDC), the global investment on AI and market is expected to break
    the $500 billion mark in 2023 (IDC [2022](#CR16)). Moreover, the statistics portal
    Statista forecasts that size of the AI market worldwide will reach over half a
    trillion U.S. dollars by 2024 (Statista [2022](#CR33)). Consequently, the evolution
    of the job market is requiring workers and stakeholders to adapt their skills
    and meta-competences to a quickly transforming scenario. According to the World
    Economic Forum, more than 60% of children starting school today will work in jobs
    that still do not exist (World Economic Forum [2017](#CR38)). Moreover, the Oxford
    Martin School of Economics reports that up to the 47% of all American job functions
    could be automated within 20 years, resulting in a very different world from the
    one we know and we operate in Frey and Osborne ([2017](#CR10)). It is particularly
    worth to notice that Gartner identifies AI as a basis for two complementary fundamental
    trends among the Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2022 (Gartner
    [2021](#CR12)): *AI engineering* and *Decision Intelligence*. AI engineering is
    focused on a complete identification and operationalization of Business Process
    Automation by the means of synergistic technological and methodological approaches,
    like AI, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Business Process Management (BPM),
    with the aim to detect and automate both business and IT processes. Instead, Decision
    Intelligence is a systemic approach to improve the organizational decision making
    by a powerful and pervasive use of both human and artificial intelligence, to

    [2017](#CR38)）。此外，牛津马丁经济学院报告称，在未来20年内，美国所有工作职能中最多可自动化47%，这将导致一个与我们所知和所处的世界非常不同的世界（Frey和Osborne
    [2017](#CR10)）。值得特别注意的是，Gartner将人工智能视为2022年度Gartner十大战略技术趋势中两个互补基础趋势之一（Gartner

    in a almost daily increasing potential to provide higher quality, greater efficiency,
    and better outcomes than human domain experts in heterogenous fields and conditions.
    In the organizational and business framework, that means that AI is prone to assist
    decision-makers and technicians beyond the scope of humans, thus not as a mere
    tool but as a decision-making assistance, also exploitable for managerial tasks.
    As an example, AI-based solutions play important roles in Unilever’s talent acquisition

    by the means of *artificial neural networks* (Shanmuganathan [2016](#CR32)), composed
    by interconnected *neurons* able to manage data and information by the means of
    “embedded” functions. The neurons are activated according to specific thresholds
    involving some parameters, then manipulate the informative elements managed and
    the resulting output information can serve as a basis for the system’s learning
    processes and further analysis. Thus, the whole sub-symbolic AI system works through
    *parallel distributed processing* mechanisms, where information is elaborated
    in parallel by the different neurons involved. Therefore, in a totally connectionist
    and *emergentist* perspective, the sub-symbolic paradigm to AI allows to model
    mental or behavioral phenomena as the emergent processes directly deriving from
    the interconnection of localized single units, linked in specific networks. These
    working mechanisms involve *statistical learning*, where models are trained on
    even large and heterogeneous datasets, as in the case of *Big Data*, related to
    specific domains. Such *second wave of AI*—as called by DARPA (Launchbury [2017](#CR21))—is

- en: 'Let us continue our overview of the current AI scenario by presenting the main
    and key symbolic methods and approaches, related to the area of knowledge representation.
    While such methods were highly hyped during the first stages of the AI history,
    it is undoubtedly clear that they are today relevant and many applications can
    be found in several application fields. Representing knowledge basically means
    formalizing it by the means of pre-defined languages, models or methodologies.
    Thus, the aim of *knowledge representation* (Handbook of Knowledge Representation
    [2008](#CR15)) is to study, analyze and apply all the widespread frameworks, languages,
    tools to represent knowledge, as well as to entail different forms of *reasoning*
    about it. The symbolic perspective is definitively fundamental, due to the key
    use of *symbols* to represent heterogeneous knowledge bases in different systems.
    In this perspective, an *intelligent agent* is endowed with a circumscribed set
    of symbols to represent the outer world (knowledge representation) and is able
    to make specific *inferences* about it according to *rules* and *principles*.
    Thus, the main ability of *knowledge-based systems* (KBS) (Akerkar and Sajja [2009](#CR3);
    Abdullah et al. [2006](#CR1)) is to logically and symbolically represent an inherently
    limited part of the world, by the means of a symbolic *modelling language*, as
    well as to reason, again by the means of a logical and formalized methodology,
    to discover further characteristics, features or properties of the represented
    world. In the useful categorization of the AI approaches by DARPA, this exactly
    corresponds to the *first wave of AI*: systems exploiting *handcrafted knowledge*,
    able to even infer significant hidden aspects, features or behaviors of the outer
    environment or agents in the specific represented world, though they lack fundamental
    cognitive abilities like *learning* or *abstracting*.'

    和 Sajja [2009](#CR3); Abdullah 等 [2006](#CR1)）的主要能力是通过一种符号化的*建模语言*逻辑地和符号地表示世界的固有有限部分，以及再次通过一种逻辑和形式化的方法推理，以发现所表示的世界的进一步特征、特性或属性。在DARPA对人工智能方法的有用分类中，这恰好对应于*第一波人工智能*：利用*手工制作的知识*的系统，甚至能够推断出特定表示世界中外部环境或代理的重要隐藏方面、特征或行为，尽管它们缺乏像*学习*或*抽象*这样的基本认知能力。
- en: In order to effectively represent knowledge, many methodologies and tools have
    been widely exploited by researchers, scholars and practitioners. It is particularly
    worth to recall the use of *logic*, and in particular of *first-order logic* (FOL),
    as a powerful methodological and formal approach to represent knowledge, adopted
    in many application fields and domains. FOL is basically able to exploit a wide
    set of *propositions*, *operators* and *quantifiers* to effectively formalize
    a *knowledge base* in a pre-defined and specified domain. Moreover, nowadays the
    role of *fuzzy logic* is fundamental, in order to allow AI systems to represent
    knowledge and make inferences in highly challenging conditions of informative
    complexity and uncertainty. Beside logics, it is also important to mention the
    role of *ontologies* and *knowledge graphs* to capture explicit and naturally
    circumscribed knowledge in a restricted domain. Indeed, the difference between
    *explicit knowledge* and *tacit knowledge* proves crucial to comprehend most of
    the main challenges and reasons of the power and limitations of knowledge representation
    and KBS. While the former is already expressed in a symbolic framework, thus easy
    and quite immediate to communicate by some language or system, the latter is *implicit*,
    empirically acquired by an individual throughout experience, education, tradition,
    social interactions, intuition and other complex dynamical knowledge-generating
    processes. Therefore, the use of ontologies and knowledge graphs as means to express
    conceptual elements, objects, and their relationships, has been traditionally
    and effectively limited to the representation of explicit knowledge, while recently
    several proposed methods and algorithms deal with the challenge of formalizing
    tacit knowledge in both organizational and industrial domains.

    society. In a broader perspective, AI is becoming a real agent, not just supporting
    humans but interacting and exchanging information and knowledge with them. It
    is then necessary to embrace a wider perspective, where humans and AI work together,
    in order to enhance and empower the decision-making processes and the whole environments
    where such actors live and act. This poses relevant and unavoidable ethical issues,
    due to the possible risks deriving from somehow “equating” humans and AI. Whereas
    the ethical concerns are fundamental and should be definitively faced and solved
    by the means of a pre-defined and widely accepted framework, this is not the aim
    of this chapter. To our scope, it is sufficient to understand that humans and
    AI work, reason and act together in advanced and diffused socio-technical systems:
    better, in *socio-AI systems* that we could not ignore or underestimate. Furthermore,
    such systems will increasingly stimulate a wide variety of *emergent collective
    behaviors*, in a complex system perspective.'

  zh: 当前 AI 的情景和发展，如本章节中简要而一般性地介绍的那样，如今已经引起了研究人员和从业者对 AI 系统与人类代理之间的作用和交互质量的关注。虽然 AI
    可以被视为一种形式的自动化，但它绝对不是单纯的技术手段：相反，它更多地是一种使能力，使整个社会拥有连续、非线性和某种程度上不可预测的动态。从更广泛的视角来看，AI
    正变成一个真正的代理，不仅仅是支持人类，而且是与人类互动并交换信息和知识。因此，有必要采用更广泛的视角，在这个视角下，人类和 AI 共同工作，以增强和加强决策过程以及这些行为者生活和行动的整个环境。这引发了一些相关且不可避免的伦理问题，因为可能会由于某种方式上“使人类与
    AI 等同”而产生的潜在风险。尽管伦理问题是基本的，应该通过预先定义的和广泛接受的框架来明确面对和解决，但这并不是本章的目的。对我们的目标来说，理解人类和
    AI 在先进和广泛分布的社会技术系统中共同工作、推理和行动是足够的：更好地说，是在 *社会 - AI 系统* 中，我们不能忽视或低估。此外，这些系统还将越来越多地激发各种
    *新兴集体行为*，从复杂系统的角度来看。

    discipline, aimed at studying, designing and evaluating interactive AI-based systems,
    as well as the potential relationships, issues and problems throughout the interaction,
    collaboration and teaming between humans and AI-based systems. HAII applies the
    classical paradigms and frameworks derived from human―computer interaction (HCI)
    to the cases where the technological interactive system is based on AI. Thus,
    the concepts related to *user*―*centered design*, *usability* and *user experience*
    are widely retained and adapted. The role of the users is fundamental: humans
    should be in the loop when designing and improving the AI systems modelling. In
    the field of HAII several frameworks for evaluating the application, interaction
    and the consequences of the exploitation of AI-based systems in heterogeneous
    application domains: one of the most important frameworks is the Artificial Intelligence
    Impact Assessment, which helps to map the potential benefits and threats of an
    AI application in a real-world situation, identify and assess the reliability,
    safety and transparency of AI systems and limit the potential risks in their deployment.
    Other frameworks and modelling instruments are aimed at identifying the current
    level of evolution and automation of the AI systems and functionalities, with
    respect to the role of the humans in the interaction: to this aim, the Parasuraman’s
    model for types and levels of human interaction with automation can be applied
    to the assessment of the degree of automation of AI-based systems.'

  zh: 在这种背景下，人工智能与人类的交互（HAII）是一门新兴且具有挑战性的学科，旨在研究、设计和评估基于人工智能的交互式系统，以及交互过程中人类与人工智能系统之间的潜在关系、问题和挑战。HAII将从人机交互（HCI）中衍生的经典范式和框架应用于技术交互系统基于人工智能的情况。因此，与*用户*
    - *中心设计*、*可用性*和*用户体验*相关的概念被广泛保留和调整。用户的角色至关重要：在设计和改进人工智能系统建模时，人类应该参与其中。在HAII领域，有几种评估应用、交互和AI系统利用的后果的框架，涵盖了各种应用领域：其中一个最重要的框架是人工智能影响评估，它有助于在实际情况中映射AI应用的潜在益处和威胁，识别和评估AI系统的可靠性、安全性和透明度，并限制其部署中的潜在风险。其他框架和建模工具旨在确定人工智能系统和功能的当前演化和自动化水平，以及与人类交互的角色：为此，可以应用Parasuraman的类型和级别人与自动化交互的模型来评估基于人工智能系统的自动化程度。
- en: 'In this perspective, AI is increasingly becoming a *teammate* and a *decision-maker*,
    not just a mere *tool* or *assistant* or agent. To be able to design and develop
    reliable and trustworthy AI systems, as well as to enhance the kinds of interactions
    with humans, *guidelines* for HAII have been designed and applied. Such guidelines
    are meant to improve *fluency*, *effectiveness* and the overall *coordination*
    between humans and AI-based systems. They consider and strive to improve all the
    stages of the operations, before, during and at the end of the interaction and
    of the whole knowledge extracting and decision-making process. The main focus,
    again, is to put the user in the loop, meaning making clear the actions, decisions,
    contextually relevant information throughout all the process. Moreover, they strive
    to ensure that all the needed information and knowledge collection stages are
    well performed and that knowledge is accurately elicited, collected and transmitted:
    thus, they highlight the importance of learning from past feedback and from user
    behavior, as well as to remember the past interactions. The idea is to enable
    the AI system to adapt and evolve in its behavior, on the basis of the previous
    knowledge and experience accumulated, together with the human agent involved.
    Following such approach, there are several methodologies and frameworks to design
    the interaction between human actors and AI-based systems, e.g. smart and *conversational
    interface*s, *anthropomorphism* and the application of *ethopoeia*, namely the
    attribution of human attitudes or intentions to machines, in the conceptual paradigm
    of the “*computer as social actors*” theory.'

  zh: 在这个角度来看，人工智能越来越成为一个*队友*和*决策者*，而不仅仅是一个简单的*工具*、*助手*或者代理人。为了能够设计和开发可靠且值得信赖的人工智能系统，以及增强与人类的互动类型，已经设计并应用了*HAII指南*。这些指南旨在提高人类和基于人工智能系统之间的*流畅度*、*有效性*以及整体*协调性*。它们考虑并努力改善操作的所有阶段，在互动过程和整个知识提取和决策过程的开始、进行和结束时。主要的重点再次是将用户置于循环中，即在整个过程中清晰地表明行动、决策和相关信息。此外，它们努力确保所有必要的信息和知识收集阶段都能够被很好地执行，并且知识能够准确地被引出、收集和传递：因此，它们强调了从过去的反馈和用户行为中学习的重要性，以及记住过去的互动。其思想是使人工智能系统能够根据积累的先前知识和经验以及涉及的人类代理人的行为来调整和发展其行为。遵循这种方法，有几种方法和框架可以设计人类行为者和基于人工智能系统之间的互动，例如智能和*会话界面*、*拟人化*以及应用*人格化*，即将人类的态度或意图归因于机器，在“*计算机作为社会行为者*”理论的概念范式中。
- en: 'At the end of this journey, what’s next? Well, there is much more waiting for
    us at the horizon! AI is currently shifting its role and characteristics in the
    whole society: starting from mere and inherently limited automated decision-support
    systems and technological infrastructure to interacting assistants, teammates
    and even *managers* and decision-makers. Thus, human and machine intelligences
    are going to combine in unpredictable and synergistic ways, reaching the so-called
    *hybrid intelligence*, where the human and the machine cognitive abilities are
    exploited together, in an unified and empowered environment, so as to achieve
    complex goals and reach superior results, while enabling continuous learning by
    a fluid and reciprocal knowledge and experience sharing between human and machine
    agents. And next? The rise of *collective hybrid intelligence* is going to revolutionize
    probably every aspect of human society, leading to an emerging, comprehensive
    and socio-AI systemic intelligence. The digital, social and cultural transformation
    stimulated by the diffused application of AI to human society arises questions
    that we need to answer, now and every day. Let us work and improve every day our
    comprehension and awareness of the potentialities and of the challenges of AI,
    to ensure that its power and advantages can serve to our sons and to all the new
    and future generations. This should always be our ultimate goal, as researchers,
    scholars and practitioners. As humans.'

  zh: 在这段旅程的尽头，接下来会是什么呢？嗯，我们在地平线上还有更多等待着我们！人工智能目前正在转变其在整个社会中的角色和特征：从仅仅是有限的自动化决策支持系统和技术基础设施，到互动助手、队友甚至*经理*和决策者。因此，人类和机器智能将以不可预测和协同的方式结合，达到所谓的*混合智能*，在这种统一和增强的环境中，人类和机器的认知能力一起被利用，以实现复杂的目标和取得优越的结果，同时通过人与机器之间流动和相互的知识和经验共享实现持续学习。接下来呢？*集体混合智能*的崛起可能会彻底改变人类社会的方方面面，导致新兴、全面的社会-人工智能系统智能的出现。由于人工智能广泛应用于人类社会所引发的数字、社会和文化转型，我们需要现在和每一天都回答的问题。让我们每天努力工作，提高对人工智能潜力和挑战的理解和意识，以确保其力量和优势能够服务于我们的子孙和所有新的和未来的一代。作为研究人员、学者和实践者，这应该始终是我们的最终目标。作为人类。
