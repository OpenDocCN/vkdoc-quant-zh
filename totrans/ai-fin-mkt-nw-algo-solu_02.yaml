    and integrated into a wide variety of software or systems for different and heterogenous
    application domains. AI is definitively and progressively emerging as transversal
    and powerful technological paradigm, due to its ability not only to deal with
    big data and information, but especially because it produces, manages and exploits
    knowledge. Researchers and scientists are starting to explore, from several perspectives,
    the different and synergetic ways AI will transform heterogenous business models
    and every segment of all industries.

    *abstracting* and *reasoning*. These cognitive capabilities are not equally distributed
    into the whole landscape of AI methods. Indeed, there is still no any single formal

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Despite the fundamental role of AI in the current technological scenario, the
    initial stages of the design, development and evaluation of AI systems are not
    actually new in the history. The official birth of the discipline dates back to
    1956, when Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy hosted the Dartmouth Summer Research
    Project on Artificial Intelligence (DSRPAI) at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.
    The Dartmouth conference involved some of the main and most important historical
    “fathers” of AI, including Allen Newell, Herbert Simon, Nathaniel Rochester and
    Claude Shannon. The primary aim of the Dartmouth event was to create a totally
    new research area focused on the challenge of designing and building intelligent
    machines. The subsequent proposal (McCarthy et al. [2006](#CR25)) set the foundations
    for the analytical study of intelligence in computers and for identifying the
    first basic concepts for applying relevant methodologies, e.g. information theory,
    to the study of AI.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nevertheless, the subsequent stages in the development of the discipline were
    not as easy as the founding fathers supposed. Despite the further creation of
    the first algorithms and computer programs, the Minsky’s optimistic claim that
    AI would have soon been able to resemble and emulate human intelligence was not
    proven, notwithstanding the efforts in that period of feverish activities. Some
    examples of the results of such years include ELIZA (Weizenbaum [1966](#CR36)),
    a natural language processing tool somehow anticipating the modern chatbots, and
    the General Problem Solver (Newell et al. [1959](#CR27)), a logic-based program,
    with the aspiration to create a universal problem solver, but actually able to
    solve specific classes of circumscribed problems. The basic approaches exploited
    in that period mostly relied on logic and explicit knowledge representation, in
    a totally *symbolic* perspective, with the aim to deal with empirical and psychological
    data by the means of deductive and linear *if–then* logical paths. Overall, the
    ambition of the first stages of AI was to quickly and strongly give rise of the
    so-called *strong AI*, or *Artificial General Intelligence*, namely AI systems
    totally able to emulate and even substitute the human, natural intelligence. Though,
    the application of the chosen purely-logical approaches gave rise to intrinsically
    limited methods, exploiting what DARPA peculiarly called *handcrafted knowledge*
    (Launchbury [2017](#CR21)) enabled reasoning capacities for just narrowly selected
    and pre-defined set of limited problems. Such systems were not endowed with any
    learning or abstracting capability, thus they did not meet the ambitious expectations
    of the founding fathers of the discipline.

    optimistic wave and conceptual blossoming of AI. In the 70’s, the US Congress
    and the British parliament harshly criticized the previous funds dedicated to
    the study and design of AI systems. In the same years, the British mathematician
    James Lighthill published the so-called *Lighthill report* (James et al. [1973](#CR17)),
    commissioned by the British Science Research Council, after a long discussion
    within universities and scholars: this report definitively started a hard period
    for AI, where the optimistic outlook given by the previous AI researchers was
    abandoned. The Lightill report collected the major reasons for disappointment,
    including the limited capabilities of the AI systems to solve real-world problems
    in generalized settings, though the obtained results into the simulation of circumscribed
    psychological processes were promising. As a result, the research in the AI field
    was partly abandoned and several support funds were ended.'

    marked a renewed period of flourishing interest and activity in AI, from a different
    and somehow opposite perspective. Aside from any ambition to replace human intelligence,
    the goal of the connectionist approach and philosophy was to study the mental
    models and the related cognitive and behavioral phenomena as emergent processes
    deriving from the working actions and interactions of interconnected neural units.
    Such conceptual shift towards the brain mechanisms somehow anticipated the further
    neuroscience involvement in AI, as well as the synergy and relationships between
    AI and *complex systems theory* (San Miguel et al. [2012](#CR30)), where brain
    and neural systems are actually prominent examples and case studies. The rise
    of connectionism started the fundamental period of study and design of *artificial
    neural networks*, trying to resemble the cognitive mechanisms on brain, while
    basically assuming that knowledge strongly derives from the interaction between
    the neural system and the outer environment. Even if the foundations of machine
    learning rooted back to the work by Donald Hebb in the 1940s, with the so-called
    *Hebbian Learning* theory (Wang and Raj [2017](#CR35)), the most significant pillars
    for its creation and initial development were stimulated by researchers like Marvin
    Minksy, James McClelland, David Rumelhart and Frank Rosenblatt, who conceived
    the *perceptron* (Rosenblatt [1958](#CR28)), namely the first model of neural
    network, thus proposing a basic method for the further studies in the *back-propagation*
    training and in *feed-forward* neural networks.

    (Langton [1986](#CR19)) and *self-organization*. The application of simulations
    and computer models to the study of self-organizing interacting agents and systems
    was another step forward to the current awareness of the need to exploit the many
    potentialities of the synergy between AI and complex systems, in the present and

    of neuroscience approaches, as well as the rise of *developmental* and *epigenetic

    Despite its still limited “intelligence”, as compared to the human one as a whole,
    the main power of AI stems from its capability to be applied to potentially every
    application field. AI represent a real quantum leap respect to other technologies,
    due to its pervasive, disruptive and technological empowering structure: it has
    been described as an *enabling technology* (Lee et al. [2019](#CR22); Lyu [2020](#CR23)),
    empowering the other technologies by its ability to produce, manage and enrich
    knowledge. These structural pillars make AI something “big” and “more” than just
    a circumscribed and mere technological artifact. AI is known to be a technological
    and methodological paradigm for the evolution of both technology itself and organization.
    Thus, given the widespread set of applications, affecting our world in many situations
    and contexts, as well as the growing interactions between AI and humans, it is
    worth to highlight how the impact of AI in society is not marginal, rather it
    has the potentialities to radically transform society in a *socio-technical* and
    *socio-AI* systemic perspective.'

    ethical issues. In spite of the powerful nature of AI, humans cannot escape the
    need to definitively decide whether they mean to manage it as a tool—rather, an
    impressive methodological and technological paradigm –, namely as a means to an
    end, or somehow as the end in itself. In another related perspective, the ethical
    challenges have always root in the human choice about how they aim to design AI
    and how they intend to exploit the potentialities, capabilities and structural
    applications of AI. This choice definitively reflects the human free will: thus,
    it is certainly a fundamental crossroad that only human intelligence and nature
    can pass. Nevertheless, the examination of the many and relevant ethical implications
    of AI in society is not the focus of this chapter.'

    Corporation (IDC), the global investment on AI and market is expected to break
    the $500 billion mark in 2023 (IDC [2022](#CR16)). Moreover, the statistics portal
    Statista forecasts that size of the AI market worldwide will reach over half a
    trillion U.S. dollars by 2024 (Statista [2022](#CR33)). Consequently, the evolution
    of the job market is requiring workers and stakeholders to adapt their skills
    and meta-competences to a quickly transforming scenario. According to the World
    Economic Forum, more than 60% of children starting school today will work in jobs
    that still do not exist (World Economic Forum [2017](#CR38)). Moreover, the Oxford
    Martin School of Economics reports that up to the 47% of all American job functions
    could be automated within 20 years, resulting in a very different world from the
    one we know and we operate in Frey and Osborne ([2017](#CR10)). It is particularly
    worth to notice that Gartner identifies AI as a basis for two complementary fundamental
    trends among the Gartner Top 10 Strategic Technology Trends for 2022 (Gartner
    [2021](#CR12)): *AI engineering* and *Decision Intelligence*. AI engineering is
    focused on a complete identification and operationalization of Business Process
    Automation by the means of synergistic technological and methodological approaches,
    like AI, Robotic Process Automation (RPA), Business Process Management (BPM),
    with the aim to detect and automate both business and IT processes. Instead, Decision
    Intelligence is a systemic approach to improve the organizational decision making
    by a powerful and pervasive use of both human and artificial intelligence, to
    model and effectively manage highly complex situations and business conditions
    by *connected*, *contextual* and *continuous* decision-making processes.'

    for the evolution and digital transformation of organizations. AI is affecting
    both the technological and organizational perspectives and processes, thus reshaping
    organizations and re-defining the interaction between technologies, management
    and business. Moreover, the continuous growth of AI methods and algorithms results
    in a almost daily increasing potential to provide higher quality, greater efficiency,
    and better outcomes than human domain experts in heterogenous fields and conditions.
    In the organizational and business framework, that means that AI is prone to assist
    decision-makers and technicians beyond the scope of humans, thus not as a mere
    tool but as a decision-making assistance, also exploitable for managerial tasks.
    As an example, AI-based solutions play important roles in Unilever’s talent acquisition
    process (Marr [2019](#CR24)), in Netflix’s decision-making processes related to
    movie plots, directors, and actors (Westcott Grant [2018](#CR37)), and in Pfizer’s

    the concurrent presence of such technological factors, enabling a fast evolution
    of the application of AI in society. The exponential phenomena we are facing by
    around the beginning of the XXI century—namely, the exponential growth in both
    computer power and data availability—and the advancement of informatics in methods,
    algorithms and infrastructures set up a synergistic system of scientific and technological
    discoveries, market opportunities and social implications. This virtuous cycle
    has been carefully recognized by the national and international institutions,
    resulting in an increasing support to technology-transfer projects, involving
    companies, start-ups, research centers and universities. The attention towards
    valuable technology-transfer projects to foster innovation in the countries has

    to question ourselves about the precise nature of *intelligence* as a whole. Cognitive

    methodologies. Moreover, the progressive improvement and evolution of the elicited

    exploit the collected data and their elaboration by the mind mechanisms. Instead,
    the further evolution of cognitive science and psychology lead to two complementary
    perspectives: on the one hand, the analogy between the mind and the computer was

    such paradigms, indeed, involve two opposite conceptions of intelligence. On the
    one hand, cognitivism assumes the mind as a computer, following logical and formal
    pre-defined rules and mechanisms, as well as manipulating symbols, encapsulating
    heterogeneous data and information, coming from the external environment, and
    proceeding through an iterative process of feedback and output results. On the
    other hand, connectionism takes into consideration the biological nature of intelligence,
    by depicting a cognitive system based on the parallel involvement of single units—*neurons*—elaborating
    the information perceived by the means of the interaction among the neurons. While
    cognitivism derives its perspective by the total analogy between the human mind
    and an artificial information processing system, working in a purely logical and
    formalized way, connectionism is based on the idea that the cognitive potential
    of the mind comes directly from the massive interaction among the interconnected
    neurons, where intelligence emerges from a distributed elaboration of the information

    The former deals with *symbols* and logical means of knowledge representation
    and management, whereas the latter works with *numbers*, non-logical and non-formalized
    representations of reality. Symbolic AI allows to manipulate the symbols by the
    means of *logical rules*, formed by predicates, connected by *logical operators*.
    In this way, all the knowledge admitted in the system can be accurately formalized
    and constrained by the means of the formal boundaries and operations exploited.
    Sub-symbolic AI, instead, allows to manipulate the informative elements and factors
    it deals with by the means of *mathematical operators*, able to manage numbers
    and data collected from the environment, and fostering further learning processes
    by the connected neurons. Overall, then, symbolic AI works at a *high-level* perspective,
    e.g. where the elements involved can be objects and relations among them. Instead,
    sub-symbolic AI operates at a *low-level*, e.g. where the elements involved can
    be image pixels, place distances, robot joint torque, sound waves etc.

    *nodes* represent specific objects by the means of logical symbols, and *edges*
    encode the logical operations to manipulate them. Everything is represented in
    a *state space*, namely a limited set of possible states allowed to configure
    a specific problem or situation. The structure is inherently *hierarchical* and
    *sequential*: starting by a *root* exemplifying the initial situation, the different
    nodes are connected through several *layers* according to the allowed situations
    and conditions considered. When all the consented actions have been performed
    in a state, the final node is a *leaf*, encoding the results of all the actions

    to get a specific result and reaching the attended state. Consequently, there
    can be various *paths* that can be followed in the graph, involving heterogeneous
    nodes and edges, from a given root to a desired leaf. Therefore, symbolic AI could

    “embedded” functions. The neurons are activated according to specific thresholds
    involving some parameters, then manipulate the informative elements managed and

    and key symbolic methods and approaches, related to the area of knowledge representation.
    While such methods were highly hyped during the first stages of the AI history,
    it is undoubtedly clear that they are today relevant and many applications can
    be found in several application fields. Representing knowledge basically means
    formalizing it by the means of pre-defined languages, models or methodologies.
    Thus, the aim of *knowledge representation* (Handbook of Knowledge Representation
    [2008](#CR15)) is to study, analyze and apply all the widespread frameworks, languages,
    tools to represent knowledge, as well as to entail different forms of *reasoning*
    about it. The symbolic perspective is definitively fundamental, due to the key
    use of *symbols* to represent heterogeneous knowledge bases in different systems.
    In this perspective, an *intelligent agent* is endowed with a circumscribed set
    of symbols to represent the outer world (knowledge representation) and is able
    to make specific *inferences* about it according to *rules* and *principles*.
    Thus, the main ability of *knowledge-based systems* (KBS) (Akerkar and Sajja [2009](#CR3);
    Abdullah et al. [2006](#CR1)) is to logically and symbolically represent an inherently
    limited part of the world, by the means of a symbolic *modelling language*, as
    well as to reason, again by the means of a logical and formalized methodology,
    to discover further characteristics, features or properties of the represented
    world. In the useful categorization of the AI approaches by DARPA, this exactly
    corresponds to the *first wave of AI*: systems exploiting *handcrafted knowledge*,
    able to even infer significant hidden aspects, features or behaviors of the outer
    environment or agents in the specific represented world, though they lack fundamental
    cognitive abilities like *learning* or *abstracting*.'

    been widely exploited by researchers, scholars and practitioners. It is particularly
    worth to recall the use of *logic*, and in particular of *first-order logic* (FOL),
    as a powerful methodological and formal approach to represent knowledge, adopted
    in many application fields and domains. FOL is basically able to exploit a wide
    set of *propositions*, *operators* and *quantifiers* to effectively formalize
    a *knowledge base* in a pre-defined and specified domain. Moreover, nowadays the
    role of *fuzzy logic* is fundamental, in order to allow AI systems to represent
    knowledge and make inferences in highly challenging conditions of informative
    complexity and uncertainty. Beside logics, it is also important to mention the
    role of *ontologies* and *knowledge graphs* to capture explicit and naturally
    circumscribed knowledge in a restricted domain. Indeed, the difference between
    *explicit knowledge* and *tacit knowledge* proves crucial to comprehend most of
    the main challenges and reasons of the power and limitations of knowledge representation
    and KBS. While the former is already expressed in a symbolic framework, thus easy
    and quite immediate to communicate by some language or system, the latter is *implicit*,
    empirically acquired by an individual throughout experience, education, tradition,
    social interactions, intuition and other complex dynamical knowledge-generating
    processes. Therefore, the use of ontologies and knowledge graphs as means to express
    conceptual elements, objects, and their relationships, has been traditionally
    and effectively limited to the representation of explicit knowledge, while recently
    several proposed methods and algorithms deal with the challenge of formalizing
    tacit knowledge in both organizational and industrial domains.

    unformalized variables, rules or behaviors, the role of the *knowledge engineering*
    is mainly devoted to improving the quality and quantity of *knowledge management
    systems* and tools. In complex organizations, this means to enhance or even to
    revolutionize the whole organizational *information systems* or their current
    functionalities. Moreover, it also means to make all the involved stakeholders
    or decision-makers aware of their potential role in the processes of *knowledge
    sharing*, knowledge management and *knowledge enrichment*. Such knowledge-based
    improvement of operational processes and human decision-making can be effectively

    environments. The ability of expert systems is definitively to focus on a narrow
    but precisely represented domain and infer solutions to problems related to that
    domain. The many applications include clinical and medical ones, industrial contexts
    and product configurators for sales and marketing. Basically, expert systems are
    apt to substitute human *domain experts* for specific processes, choices or actions.
    In this way, they help decision-makers and managers to improve the efficacy and
    the effectiveness of their decisions and actions in the course of heterogeneous
    business, organizational or industrial processes: their help is significant in
    problem solving in cases of interpreting data and information coming from sensors,
    suggesting potential diagnosis to clinicians, identifying potential risks and
    detecting behaviors, as well as helping managers to achieve business goals by
    improving planning and programming processes. Therefore, expert systems are often

    approaches. Moving step forward, the main characteristics of such systems are
    related to knowledge extraction and representation, reasoning, learning, with
    their applications and effects in different domains. Within the growing scenario
    of neural-symbolical computing, the *knowledge-based artificial neural network*
    (KBANN) and the *connectionist inductive learning and logic programming* (CIL²P)
    systems are some of the most diffused models. KBANN is a system for *insertion*,
    *refinement* and extraction of rules from neural networks. The results of the
    design and development of KBANN suggested that neural-symbolical approaches can
    effectively improve the output of a learning system by the integration of *background
    knowledge* and learning from examples. The KBANN system was the first to set this
    research path, with significant applications in bioinformatics. KBANN also served
    as one of the inspirations for the design and construction of CIL²P. This method
    integrates inductive learning from examples and background knowledge with deductive
    learning from *logic programming*. Basically, logic programming allows to represent
    a program by the means of formal logic. Thus, CIL²P allows to represent background
    knowledge by a propositional general logic program, enables training from examples
    to refine the background knowledge and the subsequent knowledge extraction steps
    are performed by the use of a network, in a logic program.

    the so-called *symbol grounding problem* (SGP). Essentially, this is the problem
    of endowing AI systems with the capacity to autonomously and automatically create
    *internal representations* to connect their manipulated symbols to their corresponding
    elements or *objects* in the external world. The methodology to ground symbols
    to environmental objects is a delicate and fundamental step in the design and
    development of a neural-symbolic AI system, often solved by grounding symbols
    to *real functions* or, in general, to some sort of *functionals* to encode the
    real-world elements characteristics and features. Solving the SGP enables effective
    propagation of information via symbol grounding, and, ultimately, the whole working
    mechanisms of the neural-symbolical network to capture and elaborate knowledge
    within the system. The way neural-symbolic approaches address and solve the SGP
    are among the differences among methods like *Deep Problog* and *logic tensor
    networks*.

    data science, learning in ontologies, training and assessment in simulators, and
    cognitive learning and reasoning methods for different applications. One of the
    most significant advantages of such systems are related to explainability. Differently
    from deep learning and *black-box* models, such systems can be explainable, thus
    allowing human decision-maker to understand the *reasons* behind their provided
    output. Indeed, the growing complexity of AI systems requires methods that can
    be able to explain users their working mechanisms and decisions. Thus, it is necessary
    and unavoidable to get a general picture of the fundamental role of *explainable
    AI* in the current scenario and evolution of AI systems.

    and future evolution of AI systems. Along with the neural-symbolical approaches,
    such methods can significantly be grouped into the so-called *third wave* of AI,
    as defined by DARPA. Thus, XAI strives to realize the big challenge of *contextual
    adaptation*, i.e. the construction of progressively explanatory methods for classes
    of real-world phenomena. While the field of XAI is actually not new in the literature
    and in AI research, nowadays its importance is constantly growing, by its ability
    to address the need for *interpretable*, *transparent* and *accountable* systems.
    The main reason behind explainable models is the general *opacity* and lack of
    *interpretability* in machine learning and deep learning models: despite the computing
    power and the high performances achieved by AI, and specifically by machine learning
    and deep learning systems, it is hard work to get insights from their internal
    mechanisms when trying to understand why some outcomes came from.'

    able to make their own decision more transparent and interpretable, so as to open
    the black box to share with users the way outputs come from. The final goal is
    to create completely explainable models and algorithms maintaining high performance
    levels. In this way, XAI allows user to enhance their interaction with the AI
    systems, by increasing their *trust* in the system mechanisms, thanks to the comprehension
    of the specific reasons why some output or decision was made. *Explainability*
    is badly needed in a wide range of applicative domains and regulations are starting
    to arise, requiring it as an essential and unavoidable feature of AI systems.

    definition of *explanation*, some key concepts emerge in the literature. To strive
    to define what precisely an explanation is the role of the user or *observer*
    is essential: in this perspective, an explanation aims at making the relevant
    *details* of an object clear or easy to understand to some observer. So, an explanation
    is able to provide users with the significant and needed information to allow
    them understand how the model works or why it made a specific decision or provided
    a particular output or suggestion. Moving a step forward, it is worth to highlight
    that an explanation is an *interface* between a human decision-maker and an intelligent
    assistant, enabling the human agent to understand some key relevant *proxies*
    to get the reasons of the system output, as well as the system internal working
    mechanisms. This adds a new dimension to the concept of explanation, showing new
    characteristics an explanation should have. It should be an accurate proxy, i.e.
    the explanation must be based on the model’s mechanisms and the input used. In
    this perspective, the challenge of generating explanations requires to guarantee
    that they have accurate proxies, which is not granted in the state-of-the-art
    models. Such proxies are intrinsically related to the *features* managed by the
    model: an explanation usually relates the feature values of an instance to its
    model prediction in a way that can be easily understood by human decision-makers,
    practitioners or organization stakeholders.'

    and characterizations of XAI systems. Explainable recommendations can either be
    *model-intrinsic* or *model-agnostic*: in the former case, the output model is
    intrinsically interpretable, meaning that the decision mechanism is completely
    transparent providing explainability; in the latter case, instead, the output
    model provides the so-called *post-hoc explanations*, without any modification
    of the model itself. These two approaches can be conceptually related to a cognitive
    psychological root: in this perspective, the model-intrinsic models would be somehow
    similar to the human mind rational decisions, while the model-agnostic ones would
    somehow resemble the intuitive ways of deciding, followed by some search of the
    explanations. This classification is also reflected in the categorization of interpretable
    AI models, Interpretable machine learning techniques can generally be grouped
    into two categories: intrinsic interpretability and post-hoc interpretability,
    where the difference is in the moment when the interpretability is obtained and
    included into the model. Intrinsic interpretability is obtained by designing self-explanatory
    models incorporating directly interpretability. Among these approaches there are
    *linear models*, *decision-trees, rule-based* systems etc. In contrast, the post-hoc
    methods are created by defining another model to include explanations for an existing
    system.'

- en: 'Another important classification, taken from the specific sub-field of *explainable
    recommender systems*, is useful for conceptually categorizing two main relevant
    dimensions in the world of XAI: the dichotomy between the *information source*
    or the *display style* perspective of the explanations and the explainable model
    perspective. The former is the way the explanations are provided to users, e.g.
    *textual explanations*, *visual explanations* etc., while the latter is the specific
    model exploited for designing and developing the considered explainable system.
    Thus, while the display style represents the *human–computer interaction* perspective,
    while the model itself is related to the machine learning dimension of XAI research.
    Overall, the role of the interaction between the user and the model is fundamental,
    when it comes to explanations: the growing diffusion of XAI and its applications
    in a wide range of application domains requires a high-quality interaction and
    the effectiveness of the information and knowledge sharing processes between the
    intelligent assistants and the human-decision makers. Therefore, the rise and

    throughout this chapter, has nowadays led to focus the researchers’ and practitioners’
    attention towards the role and the quality of the interaction between the AI systems
    and the human agents. While AI can be certainly considered as a form of automation,
    it is certainly not a mere technological means: rather, it is something more,
    enabling a continuous, non-linear and somehow unpredictable dynamics of the whole
    society. In a broader perspective, AI is becoming a real agent, not just supporting
    humans but interacting and exchanging information and knowledge with them. It
    is then necessary to embrace a wider perspective, where humans and AI work together,
    in order to enhance and empower the decision-making processes and the whole environments
    where such actors live and act. This poses relevant and unavoidable ethical issues,
    due to the possible risks deriving from somehow “equating” humans and AI. Whereas
    the ethical concerns are fundamental and should be definitively faced and solved
    by the means of a pre-defined and widely accepted framework, this is not the aim
    of this chapter. To our scope, it is sufficient to understand that humans and
    AI work, reason and act together in advanced and diffused socio-technical systems:
    better, in *socio-AI systems* that we could not ignore or underestimate. Furthermore,

    Impact Assessment, which helps to map the potential benefits and threats of an

    safety and transparency of AI systems and limit the potential risks in their deployment.
    Other frameworks and modelling instruments are aimed at identifying the current
