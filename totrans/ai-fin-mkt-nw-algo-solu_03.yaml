    led to an intertwined and still unfolding series of social, economic, and financial
    consequences. We will review several aspects of the recent pandemic crisis and
    critically compare them to extant findings on the effects of financial breaks,
    fear, and turbulences (global financial crises, terrorism, and previous pandemics)
    on financial markets. With the increase of uncertainty and volatility, the Covid-19
    pandemic also affected investors’ risk attitudes, trust, and confidence. We will
    provide insight into these behavioral aspects and how they ultimately affect financial
    decision-making. Moreover, a unique side effect of the government restrictions
    is the unprecedented increase of digitalization: never before have global citizen
    of all ages been cornered into using online services and digital tools. We will
    discuss the implications of this new phenomenon for the financial market, its
    effect on social inequality, and the scenario of opportunities it entails.'

    led to an extraordinary rate of death between the elderly and the most vulnerable
    in society, leading to an international social distancing and home isolation of
    more than 2 billion people worldwide, with tremendous social, political, and economic
    consequences (Goodell [2020](#CR32); Sharif et al. [2020](#CR50)). Moreover, one
    of the commercial effects of this virus was an unexpected disruption in the flow
    of goods and services, commodity prices and financial conditions, creating economic
    disasters across many countries because of its impact on the production and supply
    chains in China, the United States, Europe, and Japan, and other important economies
    in the world (IMF [2020](#CR35)).

    through financial channels. In contrast to the Global Financial Crisis of 2007,
    Covid-19 primarily was a shock to the real economy, initially unrelated to the
    availability of external financial means though the market’s reaction anticipated
    a potential amplification of the real shock through financial restrictions.

    we can outline three phases in the progression of the pandemic.^([1](#Fn1)) On
    December 31, 2019, cases of pneumonia detected in Wuhan, China, were first reported
    to the World Health Organization (WHO), and on January 1, 2020, Chinese health
    authorities closed the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market after it was discovered
    that the wild animals sold there may be the source of the virus (World Health

    Organization [2020](#CR56)b). Monday, January 20 was a national holiday in the

    February 24 was the first trading day in this phase and the situation plummeted
    in the following weeks. On Monday, March 9 the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)
    fell 2014 points, a 7.79% drop. Two days later, on March 11, the World Health
    Organization classified Covid-19 as a pandemic. On March 12, 2020, the DJIA fell
    2352 points to close at 21,200\. It was a 9.99% drop and the sixth-worst percentage
    decrease in history. Finally, on March 16, the DJIA collapsed by nearly 3000 points
    to close at 20,188, losing 12.9%. The fall in stock prices forced the New York
    Stock Exchange to suspend trading several times during those days.

    so far. In barely four trading days, the DJIA plunged 6400 points, an equivalent
    of roughly 26%. The sharp fall in stock market prices was caused by the authorities’
    decision to impose strict quarantines on the population and ordered a lockdown
    of most business activities to limit the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Lockdowns
    imposed to business activities put on hold most of the business operations, and
    companies reacted by adjusting their labor costs to compensate the revenue shock.
    The layoff of employees led to a sharp reduction in consumption and economic output,
    lowering companies’ stream of expected future cash flows.

    market valuations and earned positive returns of more than 10%, on average. Further,
    they study industry-level patterns and show that during March 2020 stock market
    crash, the best-performing industries include healthcare, food, software, and

    it is interesting to note when market participants became more preoccupied with
    the development of the situation. One measure used in research to gauge retail
    investor interest in a topic was developed by Da et al. [2015](#CR25) and it uses
    the intensity of search on Google. Ramelli and Wagner [2020](#CR48) exploit Google
    Trends search to capture investor sentiment and show that Global Google search
    attention on coronavirus spiked, especially after March 9, while the number of
    conference calls of international firms and the number of conference calls covering
    the coronavirus topic also increased, but spiked earlier on at the end of February.
    In their study, they find that initially, as China was effectively shut down,
    investors avoided U.S. stocks with China exposure and internationally oriented
    companies; as the virus situation in China improved relative to the situation
    in Europe and in the United States, investors perceived those companies more favorably
    again. As the virus spread in Europe and the United States, leading to lockdowns
    in these economies, markets moved feverishly.

    Flu Pandemic that killed 675,000 people in the U.S., or about 0.66% of the population.
    Most deaths occurred during the second wave in the fall of 1918\. In response,
    major U.S. cities implemented a range of actions to contain the spread of the
    virus, with different speed and stringency. These included school, theater, and
    church closures, public gathering bans, quarantine of suspected cases, and restricted
    business hours. Their results show no evidence that cities that enacted more stringent
    containment measures performed worse in the years after the pandemic. In fact,
    their findings suggest that these containment measures reduced the transmission
    of the virus without intensifying the pandemic-induced economic downturn.

    Sadique et al. [2007](#CR49); Smith [2006](#CR54)) highlighted the economic implications
    of pandemics. Outbreaks like SARS are predicted to generate immediate direct economic
    effects from the impact of the disease itself (health sector costs related to
    treatment of those infected), from policies to contain disease (public sector
    and private costs related to quarantine, isolation and school closure) and from
    the fear that is generated by the outbreak, which will affect individual behavior.
    The presence of a health threat can influence the general expectations and behavior
    of consumers and investors and, therefore, have an impact far beyond the direct
    reduction in productivity from sick patients (Sadique et al. [2007](#CR49)). For
    instance, for SARS, it has been observed that by far the largest economic impact
    occurred by reduced local and international travel and reduced engagement in non-vital
    consumption activities such as restaurants and bars, particularly in May 2003,
    as well as postponement of consumption of mostly durable goods (Richard et al.
    [2008](#CR42)). Beutels et al. [2009](#CR13) underline the importance of acknowledging
    consumers and investors adaptation to public health emergencies to provide useful
    economic analysis in the context of pandemics.

    They based their estimates using epidemiological data from past pandemics, such
    as the 1957^([3](#Fn3)) and 1968^([4](#Fn4)) influenza pandemics and applied a
    quarterly macroeconomic model of the UK economy. They used the latter two pandemics
    of the twentieth century as a base case to construct further disease scenarios
    by increasing the severity of the disease parameters, thus allowing to investigate
    what the economic effect of a more severe influenza pandemic might be.

    place of the 1918 pandemic, is driven by the observation that given the modern
    changes in societal behavior and public health policy, the economic impact of
    a recurrence of the Spanish flu would be very different in the current economy.
    However, by using the more recent pandemics as a base case for disease scenarios
    and extrapolating beyond the severity of more serious pandemics, such as 1918,
    they are able to generate some useful hypotheses and stimulate thinking on the
    potential economic impact of infectious disease outbreaks (Keogh-Brown et al.

    by infection) and indirect absenteeism (caused by school closure and ‘prophylactic’
    avoidance of work). The results of the model, of course, vary according to the
    different values attributed to the severity of the outbreak, but provide interesting
    conclusions in terms of GDP loss, consumption decline, and inflation. Most importantly,

    that operated in the San Francisco area. Real estate-related firms operating in
    other areas of California were generally unaffected by the earthquake and did

    Research on the impact of terrorist events on financial markets might provide

    consequences can be observed on major macroeconomic variables with negative shocks

    Their cross-sectional analysis of the firm’s abnormal stock returns suggests that
    the impact of terrorist attacks differs according to the home country of the target
    firm and the country in which the incident occurred. Attacks in countries that
    are wealthier and more democratic were associated with larger negative share price
    reactions. Furthermore, the results of their study suggested that human capital
    losses, such as the kidnapping of company executives, are associated with larger
    negative stock price reactions than physical losses, such as bombings of facilities

    by testing whether the stock price reaction on September 17, the first trading
    day after the attack, was the same for each airline or whether the market distinguished
    among airlines based on firm characteristics. Their cross-sectional results suggest
    that the market was concerned about the likelihood of bankruptcy in the wake of
    the attacks and distinguished between airlines based on their ability to cover
    short-term obligations. Drakos focused on the risk characteristics of airline
    stocks and reported a terrorism-induced structural shift in financial risk in
    the aftermath of the September 11 terror attacks. Drakos reported that both the
    systematic and idiosyncratic risk of airline stocks increased substantially since
    September 11, 2001\. Conditional systematic risk more than doubled, which could
    have implications for both firms and investors. Portfolio managers need to reconsider

    quite limited, but there have been few tests that have examined volatility or
    beta risks with asset-pricing models. Choudhry [2005](#CR22) investigated, post-September
    11, a small number of US firms in a variety of different industries to see if
    this terrorist event affected a shift in market betas, with mixed findings. Hon

    after the event. They also compare price responses internationally and for separate
    industries and find that reactions are strongest for local markets and for industries
    that are directly affected by the attack. The September 11 attacks turn out to

    Google search volume within the assessed time frame. The authors find that one
    standard deviation increase in news attention leads to a 0.279 standard deviation
    decrease in market returns, whereas one standard deviation increase in the authors’
    rational expectations measure leads to a decrease of 0.131 standard deviations
    of market returns. The cost for the US stock market associated to the hype of
    negative news was estimated to be USD 3.5 trillion until April 2020\. Also (Al-Awadhi
    et al. [2020](#CR4)) find negative effects on stock market returns in reaction
    to both total confirmed cases and daily Covid-19 deaths in the Chinese stock market
    and (Albulescu [2021](#CR5)) find similar results for the financial markets in
    the Unites States. Shear et al. [2020](#CR51) compare different cultures and their
    level of uncertainty avoidance. The higher the tendency of trying to mitigate
    uncertain situations, the higher the search volume for additional information.
    The results are in line with previous reports: national culture, in association
    with the uncertainty avoidance index, is a significant predictor of stock market
    returns in times of crises, in that cultures who are more risk and uncertainty
    averse tend to seek for more information, ultimately increasing their level of
    anxiety which in turn has negative effects on stock market outcomes. Similarly,
    also (Bernhofer et al. [2021](#CR12)) show that speakers of languages defined
    by a more intensive use of non-indicative (*irrealis*) moods have a higher level
    of risk aversion and invest less in risky assets. This is due to the fact that,
    semantically, the unknown is more precisely defined, hence increasing the salience
    of their regions of uncertainty.'

    was first described by John Maynard Keynes in 1936 in his prominent publication
    *The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.* In what most likely represents
    the origin of behavioral finance, he illustrates how “animal spirits”, or basic
    instincts and emotions, affect consumer confidence. In what was observed by Hippocrates
    from Kos in 400 B.C. and Claudius Galen from Pergamon in 200 A.D. as *pneuma psychikon*
    (or “animal spirits”), an invisible entity located within the cerebral ventricles
    and which moves through muscles and nerves (Herbowski [2013](#CR33); Smith et
    al. [2012](#CR53)). This approximation however appears to be indeed the original
    idea of the biological explanation behind the psychological reaction to crises
    and uncertainty as a “spontaneous urge to action”. One of the reactions to shocks
    hence appears to lie in the production of the “stress hormone”, cortisol, which
    increases as a response to e.g. market volatility and has been shown to decrease
    risk propensity (Kandasamy et al. [2014](#CR38)). Also measured anxiety and its
    consequences on financial decision-making can be, at least in part, explained
    by the surge of cortisol levels as small probabilities tend to be overweighted
    as a response to increased levels of stress. The latter phenomenon is more commonly
    observed in men compared to women.

    data-driven models is what Christopher A. Sims in the early 2000s describes with
    his renowned theory of rational inattention which has since been discussed and
    applied by numerous researchers. According to Sims’ thesis, investors do not have
    the information processing capacity in terms of data, time, and cognitive abilities
    to run highly complex models, so they take a shortcut, relying on media reports.
    While this is a money-saving technique on one hand, one of the major drawbacks
    of this approach is the exposure to *negativity bias* as the result of increased
    attention to pessimistic news. This, in turn, leads to the formation of pessimistic
    expectations and distortive effects in financial markets.

    decision-making from a slightly different angle by investigating a society’s pre-existing
    inherent level of trust and its resilience against the effects of the pandemic.
    The authors analyze data from the World Value Survey covering 47 countries and
    the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases from the end of January to the end of July
    2020\. Trust was measured with two different indices, societal trust—or trust
    in other people—and confidence in the government. Market Volatility was calculated
    as the 5-day moving average volatility and Covid-19 cases were adjusted by population
    size. Stock markets were found to be significantly less affected by new Covid-19
    case reports in those countries where societal trust and confidence in the government
    were higher. The authors hypothesize that the transmission mechanism passes through
    the level of uncertainty which is lowered by the confidence in the government’s
    rules as well as the level of trust in fellow citizens obeying new rules and prescriptions.
    The role of an active government in building trust and mediating emotional responses,
    or “animal spirits”, to crises was underlined by Akerlof and Shiller [2010](#CR3).
    It should therefore act as a responsible parent to the economy, mitigating its
    reactions to critical events.

    after the Covid-19 pandemic, such as gender, literacy, household income level,
    and income inequality at the country level. On one hand, women benefit nearly
    twice as much as men and are also those who had a lower ex-ante digital literacy,
    but on the other hand, those who have better reading skills benefit slightly more
    from the digital transformation initiated by the pandemic. Interestingly, there
    does not appear to be any differential effect for respondents with a monthly income
    higher than the median of their country, but more importantly that countries characterized
    by higher levels of income inequality are on average 7.5 times more likely to
    have experienced an increase in digital literacy during the lockdown.Table 3.1

    of credit. Small businesses and private citizens often cannot provide the sufficient
    proof of creditworthiness and without financial resources, a significant share
    of the population is cut out from the market thus hindering innovation and productivity.
    The most affected share of the population is represented by citizen with low income,
    women, and ethnic minorities. Artificial Intelligence has the potential to overcome
    these limitations as potential recipients can be evaluated in different domains:
    the creditworthiness of an individual is therefore not limited to their financial
    history but could extend, for example, to their social network activity and behavior,
    geographical location, and online purchases. Under the condition that equal access
    to digital technology is granted, the recent developments allow for a worldwide
    inclusion into financial, educational, and commercial realities of disadvantaged
    and geographically remote populations. In Bangladesh for example, iFarmer is a
    crowdfunding platform that puts together female cattle farmers targeting potential
    investors. Digital lending has experienced a significant increase with the onset
    of the pandemic with the special form of Fintech, P2P (peer-to-peer) lending over
    apps, becoming more frequently an alternative to banks or other financial intermediaries
    (Arninda and Prasetyani [2022](#CR8)). Loans in such platforms are transferred
    from individual to individual, cutting bureaucracy and costs in a substantial
    way. Crowdfunding and P2P lending have already existed before the pandemic (Agur
    et al. [2020](#CR1); Lin et al. [2017](#CR43)), but the level of digital literacy
    acquired opens up for an unprecedented number of opportunities for targeted policy
    interventions aimed at putting together philanthropists with who was left behind
    during the last two years and small start-up projects with potential, but with
    little traditional creditworthiness with small venture capitalists without geographical
    constraints. Similar to dating apps, borrowers and lenders meet on matchmaking

    mutual trust in both the lender and the borrower. AI has been widely applied in
    the area of critical infrastructures, for example in public health, transport,
    water supply, electricity generation and telecommunications, increasing their
    resilience in case of extreme events. The same concept of resilience should be
    applied to financial assets of small and medium businesses and private citizens:
    in case of extreme events such as pandemics or other disasters, financial assets
    must be protected and able to recover quickly from such shocks. This could be
    achieved, among other solutions, by nudging small investors into choosing stocks
    with a higher ES (environmental and social) rating as they are shown to react
    less to volatility in the market (Albuquerque et al. [2020](#CR6)), by increasing
