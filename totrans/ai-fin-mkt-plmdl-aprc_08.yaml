- en: We conclude the book by giving a summary of the answers it brings to the different
    questions raised at the beginning. We recap how the different concerns about the
    limits of Polymodel Theory have been addressed. Returning to the different applications
    discussed throughout the book, we outline how polymodels successfully contribute
    to the literature of financial market predictions, thus providing an effective
    artificial intelligence technique when applied to financial markets.

    simple model of portfolio returns, which is represented as a function of the market,
    the industry and the specific components of the stock returns:![$$ {r}_P={\varOmega}_p\left({r}_M,{\mathcal{F}}_I,{\mathcal{F}}_S\right).

    in the introduction, we emphasized the fact that superior portfolio performances,
    which add value on top of the simple portfolios such as the market portfolio,
    may come from three sources:'

- en: In Chap. [4](519851_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml), we proposed a market timing signal
    which seems to be an effective predictor of future market returns. This is a contribution
    to the second source of superior portfolio performances. The chapter contributes
    to the broad literature on the detection of Systematic Risk via the analysis of
    correlation structures of the stock markets. Instead of measuring correlations,
    we estimated a polymodel and measured the root-mean squared error of each of the
    elementary models. The distribution of the RMSE was found to be predictive of
    future market drawdowns in a non-trivial manner, since we observed an extremization
    of the links, some economic variables being more correlated to the market before
    crisis, and some others (most of them) less. Such an application of Polymodel
    Theory shows its effectiveness as a tool to analyze a particular node of a complex
    system. We derived a market timing strategy from our Systemic Risk indicator,
    which had a gross Sharpe ratio of 0.68 for the S&P 500, versus 0.35 for being
    simply invested in the market (these numbers are computed with equal volatility
    of portfolio returns). This increase in the market portfolio performance is shown
    to be highly statistically significant, and subsists despite a large panel of
    robustness tests.

    by proposing a new industry risk premium, the antifragility factor, derived from
    the concept of antifragility developed by Taleb. It has been shown to be a significant
    predictor of industry returns, particularly profitable (the gross Sharpe ratio
    achieved is 1.10). The signal survives a large array of robustness tests, and
    regressions on well-known factors show that the alpha is different than the classical
    Fama & French factors. Notably, it subsumes other factors that try to capture
    the premia for extreme market risk (Downside Beta and Coskewness). Thus, this
    chapter is another contribution to the literature which shows the importance of
    non-linear modeling in finance.

- en: Another contribution to this first source of superior portfolio performance
    is brought by Chap. [6](519851_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml), which uses polymodels as
    a machine learning method to predict the specific component of the cross-section
    of stock returns. For each of the 500 stocks of the cross-section we invest in,
    we define a polymodel of 1,134 predictors, which is re-estimated dynamically.
    Sophisticated selection and aggregation methods are developed to tackle this datamining
    exercise. The selection is performed using a rolling double filter and the aggregation
    takes into account both the goodness of fit and the correlation of the predictors
    thanks to the use of Information Theory. The usage of a prediction aggregation
    method which takes into account the correlation of the predictors is an important
    question for Polymodel Theory (as mentioned in Chap. [2](519851_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml)),
    which finds a first answer in this chapter. The trading strategy implemented on
    the base of these specific predictions showed a gross Sharpe ratio of 0.91.

- en: The third source of portfolio over-performance consists in defining an appropriate
    combination function “omega” for market, industry and specific predictions. This
    problem is tackled in Chap. [7](519851_1_En_7_Chapter.xhtml), in which we combine
    the factor portfolios obtained from the three previous chapters. Using a Risk
    Parity combination, the aggregate trading strategy reached a gross Sharpe ratio
    of 1.58, which shows the high and consistent predictive power of the predictions.
    While introducing realistic (potentially conservative) values of transaction costs,
    the performance declines, justifying the development of a combination method based
    on a genetic algorithm, partly inspired by the dynamic programming model of Gârleanu
    and Pedersen. The genetic algorithm aims to solve a nested optimization problem
    which allows us to simultaneously obtain optimal weights for the three sub-portfolios
    as well as the optimal trading rate for the strategy. It is shown to outperform
    the Risk Parity combination from the statistical significance perspective. The
    final aggregated portfolio has a Sharpe ratio net of transaction costs of 0.94\.
    A natural benchmark for this portfolio would be the simple portfolio defined in
    the introduction:![$$ {r}_{simple\_ portfolio}={\beta}_M{r}_M+{\beta}_{mom}{r}_{mom}+{\beta}_{size}{r}_{size}+{\beta}_{value}{r}_{value}.
    $$](../images/519851_1_En_8_Chapter/519851_1_En_8_Chapter_TeX_Equ2.png)(8.2)Since
    our aim was to produce novel alpha signals and methods, we avoided any investment
    in the momentum, size and value factors. Hence, the portfolio against which the
    final strategy is benchmarked is the market portfolio, which reached a Sharpe
    ratio of 0.43 on the same period. Thus, net of transaction costs, the aggregated
    trading strategy more than doubles the performance of the market portfolio, which
    is the most convincing indicator of the predictive power of the predictions developed
    throughout the book.

- en: The book thus contributes to the three sources of superior portfolio performance
    mentioned in the introduction. The development of these novel prediction methods
    and alpha signals would not have been possible without Polymodel Theory, which
    is extensively presented in Chap. [2](519851_1_En_2_Chapter.xhtml). Complementing
    the empirical applications of polymodels made in the following chapters, this
    second chapter highlights the theoretical benefits of using polymodels for the
    general purpose of modeling. In particular, it shows that polymodels are especially
    suitable for solving artificial intelligence problems which need to manage large
    amounts of data in a data-driven, robust, accurate, and non-overfitted manner.

- en: For the particular question of the estimation of the elementary models which
    compose the polymodels, a novel technique, the Linear-Non-Linear-Mixed model,
    is presented in Chap. [3](519851_1_En_3_Chapter.xhtml). The LNLM model proposes
    to regularize the non-linear part of a polynomial model by mixing it with a linear
    model. The resulting shrinkage of non-linearity is obtained by a customized usage
    of Stratified Cross-Validation. Simulations showed both the effectiveness of the
    LNLM model to reduce over-fitting as well as good performances in terms of computation
    time. This last point is particularly important since some of the applications
    presented in the book required several billion model estimations. LNLM was thus
    revealed to be an appropriate solution to work in a big data framework, on top
    of being successfully used to produce the predictions of Chaps. [4](519851_1_En_4_Chapter.xhtml),
    [5](519851_1_En_5_Chapter.xhtml) and [6](519851_1_En_6_Chapter.xhtml).

- en: Polymodels estimated by the LNLM model are shown throughout the book to be useful
    for financial applications, however, these tools are quite general, and can be
    used in any field in which applied mathematics find interest. The prediction methods,
    as they ultimately capture behavioral biases which prevent market efficiency,
    also have the potential to be applied in any financial market and are not restricted
    to the equity market.

- en: The simple model we presented for describing the returns of a portfolio invested
    in the stock market should be enriched. If fed properly by incorporating the vast
    number of predictors which exist in the literature, it can become an extremely
    powerful framework for constructing predictions. The aggregation function omega
    is scalable in the form presented in the book, but it should evolve in a more
    general direction, for example by being estimated through a deep neural network
    in order to benefit from the latter’s property of being a universal function approximator.

- en: The results of the book again confirm the absence of market efficiency. We have
    proved the possibility of consistently beating the market, but bearing in mind
    the perspectives that the framework we established offers, the book is clearly
    only a first draft of what is achievable regarding the prediction of financial
    markets.
