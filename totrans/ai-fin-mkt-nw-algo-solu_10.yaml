  zh: 摘要
- en: 'The computational social science is a challenging interdisciplinary field of
    study, aimed at studying social phenomena by merging the traditional research
    of social science with the use of a computational and data-driven approach. In
    the conceptual framework of the complex systems science the environment where
    these phenomena live and act can be seen as a social system, composed of many
    elements, the agents, which form a social complex network: thus, the agents can
    be represented by the nodes of a network, whose reciprocal positions determine
    the resulting network structure. Therefore, the complex systems science perspective
    proves particularly useful in order to study the interactions occurring in a social
    environment: as a matter of fact, these mechanisms give rise to emergent collective
    behaviors at the system level. Hence, the aim of the computational social science
    is to study the different interaction mechanisms so as to understand their role
    in the rise of the collective social phenomena. In order to perform effective
    and robust studies, plenty of models have been proposed, ranging from general
    social dynamics and social spreading to crowd behavior and opinion, cultural or
    language dynamics, or hierarchy or segregation formation. In this context, opinion
    dynamics is definitively a fundamental social behavior to study. By everyday experience,
    one of the most important social phenomenon is agreement: especially when it comes
    to a discussion involving different opinions, the process of reaching at least
    a partial agreement proved to be a basic catalyst of the evolution of the human
    thinking during time. From the dynamics of the single individuals’ interactions
    to the opinion dynamics in large populations, there are many situations in the
    social and political life in which a community needs to reach a consensus. Through
    a process of progressive agreements on different themes, some opinions spread,
    some others disappear and some others evolve through merging and non-linear memetic
    processes: in this way, the dominant macro-culture is formed and evolves in a
    society. Therefore, opinion dynamics models can be seen as a sub-set of the so-called
    consensus models. In general, a consensus model allows to understand if and how
    a set of interacting agents can reach a consensus when choosing among several
    options: political vote, opinions, cultural features are well-known examples of
    them. The agent-based modelling methodology proves particularly useful to represent
    the individuals’ behavior and analyze the population dynamics. In the literature,
    plenty of models are aimed at studying opinion dynamics: each model proposed can
    often be modified with various variants. In this chapter, we will present the
    overall scenario of opinion dynamics, by showing the main challenges and approaches
    to study and analyze consensus formation in heterogeneous settings and conditions.'

    mathematical the process of the evolution of *opinions* in the course of heterogeneous
    social *interactions* among *agents* (Xia et al. [2011](#CR39); Zha et al. [2020](#CR40)).
    While this field of study is definitively not recent in the literature, its popularity
    has nowadays grown up: indeed, the increasing interest in *complex systems* and
    *computational social science* (Lazer et al. [2009](#CR27); Conte et al. [2012](#CR12))
    is definitively stimulating the advancement of such discipline, as well as its
    application in a wide range of concrete real-world scenarios, e.g. in politics,
    sociology and also in finance. In this perspective, opinion dynamics strives to
    model the complex phenomena occurring during the interactions among agents, which
    give rise *to emerging behaviors* at the system’s level: generally, the agents
    are interconnected by the means of some simple or complex *social network*, allowing
    some specific interactions, *coordination* and *information exchange* processes
    (Patterson and Bamieh [2010](#CR32); Fotakis et al. [2018](#CR17)). Such mechanisms
    are inherently bounded and limited in their nature, orienting the underlying dynamics
    and thus allowing scholars and researchers to focus their study towards specific
    phenomena and situations: in the computational social science perspective, then,
    the challenge is to effectively model the interaction mechanisms, so as to understand
    their role in the rise of *collective social phenomena*.'

    processes among groups of agents, socially and physically organized in some sort

    importance was already pointed out by philosophy and logic, from Heraclitus to

    way, the dominant macro-culture is formed and evolves in a society. Therefore,
    the mathematical and statistical study of the different social and cultural phenomena

- en: 'In opinion dynamics, the process of designing, adapting, choosing and evaluating
    the right model under specific static or evolving conditions and boundaries requires
    a twofold view: on the one hand, it is necessary to model the single, precise,
    *local* interactions among agents in social groups, usually physically or socially
    *neighbors* or “similar” to some extent. The concepts of *neighborhood*, *similarity*,
    capability or specific *thresholds* to be respected for allowing the interaction
    should be accurately established and pre-defined. In general, the local interactions
    among agents are modeled by the so-called *update rules*, encapsulating the specific
    mechanisms and relationships while taking into consideration the network features
    and structures where the agents act and interact. Simple, circumscribed local
    interactions and knowledge exchange processes give rise to *global*, general,
    emerging behaviors at the whole social network level (Bolzern et al. [2020](#CR5);
    Giardini et al. [2015](#CR19)). Thus, one of the main aim of opinion dynamics
    is to study and analyze the way and the overall time required by a social system
    to reach the consensus, under several *boundary conditions*. Generally, the final
    state rends to assume one of three classical *stable states*: consensus, *polarization*
    and *fragmentation* (Zha et al. [2020](#CR40)). As everybody’s daily experience
    suggests, in social communities or interactions, there is no guarantee that a
    consensus is always reached: in some cases, two final opinions emerge, polarizing
    the population to two clusters, or, in other cases, no leading opinions appear,
    thus the population opinions are fragmented in a certain number of clusters. Therefore,
    opinion dynamics takes into consideration some specific conceptual elements for
    constructing effective and complete models: the opinions expression formats, i.e.
    how the opinions are expressed and modeled (e.g. continuous, discrete, binary
    etc.), the opinion evolution rules, namely the update rules governing the system
    dynamics, and the opinion dynamics environment, that is the social network enclosing
    the agents under specific, circumscribed social or physical relationships.'

  zh: 在舆论动态中，设计、调整、选择和评估在特定静态或演变条件和边界下的正确模型的过程需要双重视角：一方面，有必要对社会群体中代理之间的单一、精确的*本地*相互作用进行建模，这些代理通常在物理上或社会上*邻近*或在某种程度上“相似”。必须准确建立和预定义*邻域*、*相似性*、能力或特定*阈值*的概念，以允许这种相互作用。一般来说，代理之间的局部相互作用由所谓的*更新规则*来建模，这些规则封装了具体的机制和关系，同时考虑了代理行动和相互作用的网络特征和结构。简单、局限的局部相互作用和知识交换过程导致在整个社会网络水平上产生*全局*、一般的、新兴的行为（Bolzern等人[2020](#CR5);
    Giardini等人[2015](#CR19)）。因此，舆论动态的主要目标之一是研究和分析社会系统达成共识所需的方式和整体时间，在几种*边界条件*下。一般来说，最终状态倾向于假定三种经典的*稳定状态*之一：共识、*极化*和*分裂*（Zha等人[2020](#CR40)）。正如每个人的日常经验所表明的那样，在社会群体或交互中，并没有保证总是达成共识：在某些情况下，会出现两种最终意见，将人口极化为两个群集，或者，在其他情况下，没有出现主导意见，因此人口意见在某些群集中分裂。因此，舆论动态考虑了一些构建有效和完整模型的具体概念要素：意见表达格式，即意见如何表达和建模（例如，连续、离散、二进制等）、意见演变规则，即管理系统动态的更新规则，以及舆论动态环境，即在特定的、局限的社会或物理关系下围绕代理的社会网络。

    is challenging. To our scope, we aim to allow reader to orient himself or herself
    in the set of traditional, basic and fundamental models we will report in the
    next sections. The final aim is to let the reader appreciate their specific advantages
    or potential applications when it comes to finance and its challenges. Therefore,
    this work is surely not intended as an exhaustive review of the models in the
    literature.

    *dimensionality* and *tipology* of opinions. Indeed, on the one hand opinions
    can be represented by *one-dimensional or multi-dimensional* vectors (Sîrbu et
    al. [2017](#CR35)); on the other hand, the vectors modelling the opinions can
    be either *discrete* or *continuous* (Zha et al. [2020](#CR40); Sîrbu et al. [2017](#CR35)).
    Multi-dimensional opinions can be useful when modelling agents characterized by
    a set of *characteristics* or *features* of their whole opinions. This happen
    in the case of the Axelrod model (Sîrbu et al. [2017](#CR35)), where the agents
    are endowed with different cultural features modeling the different believes or
    attitudes of the individuals in the population. Instead, one-dimensional, classical
    opinion dynamics model are widely used to study opinion dynamics in different
    conditions and population, focusing on specific kinds of opinions and on their
    evolution according to the rules governing the system. Moreover, opinions can
    be either discrete or continuous. In the former case the components of the opinion
    vector can only assume discrete values, thus encapsulating a finite number of
    possible states, while in the latter case the components of the opinion vectors
    are continuous, assuming values in the domain of real numbers (with any specific
    constraints, if needed). Finally, in the literature there are also hybrid models,
    where the different possibilities are mixed according to the specific social phenomena
    or behaviors to study and simulate, e.g. in the CODA (continuous opinions and
    discrete actions) model (Zha et al. [2020](#CR40); Sîrbu et al. [2017](#CR35))
    we will report.'

    for studying and appreciating the different opinion dynamics models in the literature.
    In particular, it could be possible to consider other significant differentiation
    elements, specifically the types of *stable states* reached in the consensus formation
    process, as well as the agents’ behaviors, the social phenomena studied, or even
    the kind of social network exploited. In any case, it could be possible to construct
    arbitrary classifications or categorizations of the many models in the literature
    by focusing on the presence or absence of specific modelling factors. Notably,
    the role of *information representation* and *information sharing* could be fundamental
    to further explore the possible classifications of opinion dynamics models, especially
    when it comes to the role of *external information*, namely deriving from information
    sources that are external respect to the system population (e.g. mass media broadcast).
    Nevertheless, we decided to make the classification chosen as simple as possible,
    to focus on the main fundamental models and their application in finance, as anticipated
    before.

    for more advanced models or extensions. According to De Groot, the *opinion formation*
    process and their dynamics are defined according to a *linear combination* of
    the initial opinions of the interacting agents. Then, let us consider the set
    of the agents ![$$A=\{{a}_{1},{a}_{2},\dots ,{a}_{m}\}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png)

    at round ![$$t$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq4.png).
    As the model uses a linear combination for defining the evolving opinions of the
    agents, we introduce the weight ![$${w}_{ij}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq5.png)
    the agent ![$${a}_{i}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq6.png)
    assigns to agent ![$${a}_{j}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq7.png),

    must be satisfied. Then, the De Groot model exploits the following update rule,
    governing the evolution of the opinion of agent ![$${a}_{i}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq10.png):![$${o}_{i}^{t+1}={w}_{i1}{o}_{1}^{t}+{w}_{i2}{o}_{2}^{t}+\dots

    ={W}^{t}\times {O}^{0},$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_Equc.png)where
    ![$$W={\left({w}_{ij}\right)}_{m\times m}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq11.png)

    {R}^{m}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq14.png).
    This model is inherently linear and it is traceable over time. It is an iterative
    averaging model and the consensus can be reached: according to De Groot, if there
    is a time ![$$t$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq15.png)
    such that every element in at least one column of the matrix ![$${W}^{t}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq16.png)
    is positive, then it is possible to reach the consensus. In other words, a consensus
    can be reached if there exists a power ![$$t$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq17.png)
    of the weight matrix when ![$${W}^{t}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq18.png)
    has a strictly positive column. Due to its simplicity and linearity, the De Groot
    model presents several extensions in the literature: these are the so-called DeGrootian
    models (Degroot [1974](#CR15); Noorazar et al. [2020](#CR30); Noorazar [2020](#CR29)).
    One of the most diffused ones is the *Friedkin-Johnsen* model (Noorazar [2020](#CR29);
    Friedkin and Johnsen [1990](#CR18)), which include *stubborn agents* in the system,
    by considering a parameter representing the *susceptibility* of each individual
    agent, namely the level of *stubbornness*.'

    their opinions will possibly change, otherwise they definitively do not consider
    each other because the two ideas are too far from each other. If the threshold
    assumes the same value for all the agents, then the bounded confidence model is

    of the most classical approaches in statistical mechanics to analyze the *phase
    transitions* in ferromagnetic materials. In the field of opinion dynamics, it
    has been studied to model social interactions in situations where the agents have
    binary opinions, represented by *spins*, which can be *up* or *down*. This choice
    can seem inherently limited, but it proved to be useful in real-life situations
    where people have to deal with a choice between two opposite options regarding
    a specific topic. Spin couplings are used to represent peer interactions among
    the agents. Furthermore, the model also considers another element, which is external
    information (e.g. media promotion), represented by the magnetic field in the model.
    Thus, the energy of interaction, called ![$$E=-J{o}_{i}{o}_{j}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq67.png)

    it is possible to find several hybrid approaches, mixing different kinds of opinions
    or merging heterogeneous models, with the aim to mutually reinforce the methods

    be either a way to study certain behaviors or mechanisms in a larger and more
    comprehensive framework, also to effectively create a method able to better simulate
    them in a real-world application or scenario. In this short section, we briefly
    present the Continuous Opinions and Discrete Actions (CODA) model, providing a
    explanatory approach for hybridization of discrete and continuous elements in

    (very usual) situation where an individual faces two conflicting opposite opinions
    to choose. Then, each agent ![$$i$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq82.png)
    has to pick one choice between two discrete (binary) opinions. In this scenario,
    it is reasonable to assume that each agent ![$$i$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq83.png)
    would choose one of the two alternatives with a probability ![$${p}_{i}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq84.png).
    The CODA approach helps to model such probability, allowing to model the degree
    of choosing a certain discrete opinion, under specific conditions. Then, we have
    a variable representing the two opposite choices, namely ![$$x=\pm 1$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq85.png),
    and all the agents are represented on a square lattice with a continuous probability
    ![$${p}_{i}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq86.png)
    denoting the degree of agreement to the opinion ![$$+1$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq87.png),
    while the probability ![$$1-{p}_{i}$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq88.png)
    corresponds to the extent of agreement to the opinion ![$$-1$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq89.png).
    The agents choose a discrete opinion by using a threshold ![$${\sigma }_{i}=sign\left({p}_{i}-1/2\right)$$](../images/524458_1_En_10_Chapter/524458_1_En_10_Chapter_TeX_IEq90.png).
    Moreover, each agents states which choice is preferred, thus informing the others.
    All the agents only see the discrete opinion of the others and change the corresponding
    probability according to their neighbors, by the means of a specific Bayesian
    update rule, with the aim to stimulating and favoring agreement in the neighborhood.
    The interaction among the neighbors can happen according to different schemas,
    either a Voter model one, where each agent interacts with one neighbor at each
    step, or a Sznajd model one, where two neighbors are able to influence the other
    ones. In any cases, the model shows the emergence of extremism even without extreme
    opinions at the beginning. Several extensions of the model have been studied,
    e.g. the presence of migration in the agents social network, namely the possibility
    for the agents to move and change their position respect to the other agents in
    the network. Other cases include the inclusion of a third possible opinion allowed,
    as well as the possibility to provide the agents with some “awareness” of the
    effect they produce on the other individuals. Finally, it is worth to mention
    the possibility to include some “trust” in the system, by making each agent able
    to judge the other ones, categorizing them into “trustworthy” and “untrustworthy”.
    In each case, the possible emergence of consensus or polarization is studied under
    several heterogeneous conditions.

    or psychological phenomena or behaviors into the structure or into the interactions
    among the agents. In order to fully exploit the potentialities of some models,
    sometimes they are extended to multiple dimensions of opinions. Indeed, until
    now we only considered one-dimensional models, which prove to be effective in
    many real-world scenarios and concrete applications. Nevertheless, many situations
    require more than one dimensions to adequately represent the full range of the

    necessary and worth to mention the multi-dimensional case, enabling the design,
    development and application of several methods, either specifically created for
    these situations or extended from the one-dimensional case. At a first glance,
    such models could appear somehow strange or useless in real-world scenarios. Instead,
    such models are particularly appliable and necessary when the opinions of the
    agents in the population are composed and influenced by a series of heterogeneous
    variables, representing their features or characteristics, related to different
    sociological, political or cultural traits, influencing and composing the whole
    opinion. Then, the use of multi-dimensional models can be even more realistic
    or useful than for real-life complex scenarios, where agents, their opinions and
    characteristics are complex and related to several dimensions. Consequently, plenty
    of studies in the literature are focused on exploring such models, often extending
    and adapting the one-dimensional classical cases, as it happens for bounded confidence
    models. Among the aspects that are particularly studied in the literature, there
    are the change in *confidence levels*, the model *convergence*, *robustness* and
    *stability* in heterogeneous conditions influencing the appearance of consensus,
    polarization or segmentations of the opinions in the population. In this short
    section, we briefly present the main aspects of the well-known Axelrod model,

    set of similar features. Homophily is a common sociological phenomenon and it
    can lead to the emergence of clusters in the population of the interacting agents,
    in many kinds of social networks and social communities. The latter, instead,
    refers to the tendency of the individual to become more similar after their interaction,

    their features, respectively. This model lead a randomly-initialized population
    to two possible absorbing states: either a sort of consensus, namely an ordered
    states where the agents share traits, or a sort of segmentation, where multiple
    clusters of different traits co-exist in the population. The final state specifically

    lends itself to many possible adaptations, modifications or even extensions to
    more general structures. Among the possible modified versions, it is relevant
    to mention the cases of modification of the update rule, e.g. always allowing
    to choose a pair of interacting agents, instead of randomly selecting them. Other
    interesting models exploit the so-called *cultural drift*, namely external *noise*
    influencing the formation of cultural clusters and the appearance of consensus.
    Finally, it is also possible to change the attitudes of the agents toward the
    change in their opinion, e.g. including some threshold for the overlap, determining

    studies. Let us remind that the financial market is inherently a complex systems,
    where a large set of human agents interact, exchange information, trade and create
    groups with internal dynamics. This is the basic concept to take into consideration
    when striving to comprehend the many possible applications of opinion dynamics
    and, in general, mathematical modeling of social behavior, to the financial domain.
    Moreover, it is also necessary to recall that such agents are endowed with heterogeneous
    properties, e.g. related to their *cultural*, *sociological* or *demographic*
    features, as well as different *strategies of investments* and *risk propensity*.
    These characteristics and behaviors at the *micro*- and *meso*-level give rise
    to emergent phenomena, influencing the evolution of the financial market and,
    in general, of the whole society. In this context, opinion dynamics proved to
    be a useful methodological and mathematical tool to model the structure of social
    networks in the financial domain, simulate the range of possible behaviors and
    study emergent and collective phenomena in real-world situations. While in the
    financial situations it is common to exploit binary models, allowing to study
    the cases where the agents have to choose between two opposite actions, it is
    generally possible to find applications of the already presented basic models
    or their extensions, as well as newly created models, specifically designed to
    analyze particular situations or scenarios.

    binary case, which is not a problem as this is a typical scenario in the real-world
    applications of opinion dynamics and in finance. The Ising model can be used to
    model the interactions and *trading strategies* among *bullish* and *bearish*
    traders, in an environment acting with external forces influencing the interactions
    and behaviors of the agents. Moving a step forward, there are extensions able
    to better represent the forces at work in this case: in particular, the Ising
    model basic elements can be extended to also take into consideration the so-called
    *mutual influences*, namely the i*nteraction strength* or the influence of the
    decision of a trader to some other one, but also the *external news* or other
    possible external forces influencing the trader decisions and possible trader
    characteristics or traits. Other possible extensions of the Ising model enlarge
    the range of the potential trader choice, allowing the agents to decide whether
    to buy, sell or not to act. Therefore, the Ising model proved to be useful both
    for modeling the agents features and the forces influencing their interactions,

    and time. In addition, the level of complexity can be increased by considering
    both opinion and *information exchange* among the agents. As the structure of
    the models include more elements than in the most classical and basic methods,
    it can be appropriate to exploit *analytical* solutions of the models, based on
    the use of *differential equations*, instead of the numerical and computer simulations.
    All these possibilities are generally present in the so-called *kinetic models*,
    which are used for studying the evolution of speculative markets, or the mechanism
    of *price formation* and changing and risk propensity. Instead, other models try
    to merge the agent-based and classical opinion dynamics methodology to the use
    of machine learning, in a data-driven and more computational way. Such synergy
    gives rise to probabilistic models to study opinion dynamics by the means of the
    use of a wide set of probabilistic parameters, which can be useful to study the
    opinion evolution processes in complex stochastic situations. From the analytical
    point of view, in this case often the *stochastic differential equations* are
    employed, as well as neural network structures, to help study the nonlinear dependencies
    and opinion dynamics in the social networks.

- en: Overall, opinion dynamics is a highly promising methodological tool to help
    scholars, researchers and practitioners to deeply understand the market structures
    and evolution, to capture relevant and hidden social and financial phenomena and
    predict the future market states in a wide range of potential applications and
    situations. We are convinced that further studies of such methods, especially
    in synergy with the many computational potentialities of machine learning and
    deep learning, will shed light on many social and financial mechanisms, thus allowing
    to take a step forward toward the comprehension of one of the more fascinating
    complex systems, deeply affecting our everyday life.
