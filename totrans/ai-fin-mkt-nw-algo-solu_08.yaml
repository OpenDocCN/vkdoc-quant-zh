- en: The Non- Performing Exposures are an asset financial class that sees large volumes
    of credits of banking origin traded on the free market through assignment operations.
    The issue of credit enhancement therefore acquires a central role in the credit
    purchase process. In this study we describe an approach to the issue of valuing
    Non Performing Exposures based on AI algorithms and calculation methods rather
    than traditional econometrics. The following approach has been studied for the
    Italian NPE market, as it has unique characteristics in terms of size, legal and
    technical-real estate aspects.

    for which the debtor has no longer been able to honor payments. The debtor enters
    a state of insolvency and the credit is classified as non-performing becoming
    a Non Performing Exposure or NPE. Three different types of NPE are identified
    based on the number of months that have passed since the last payment made by
    the debtor to the institution that granted the credit.

- en: The use of a credit enhancement system based on the use of an Expert System
    has the advantage of explaining the physical phenomenon underlying the credit
    recovery process in a transparent and verifiable way. Rules can be subjected to
    empirical testing over time to check adherence to the physical reality they describe.
    Furthermore, new rules can be added over time as environmental conditions change.
    In particular, new regulatory obligations or considerations on the application
    of macroeconomic parameters.
