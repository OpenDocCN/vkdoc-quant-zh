- en: We propose a Systematic Risk Indicator derived from a polymodel estimation.
    Polymodels allow us to measure the strength of the links that a stock market maintains
    with its economic environment. We show that these links tend to be more *extreme*
    before a market crisis, confirming the well-known increase of correlations while
    proposing a more subtle perspective. A fully automated and successful trading
    strategy is implemented to assess the interest of the signal, which is shown to
    be strongly significant, both from an economic and statistical point of view.
    Results are robust across different time-periods, for various sets of explanatory
    variables, and among 12 different stock markets.

- en: Sornette (see Johansen et al. ([2000](#CR4)) and Sornette ([2009](#CR11))) has
    been a pioneer in the anticipation of stock market crashes with his LPPL model
    (also well described in Geraskin and Fantazzini ([2013](#CR2))). Essentially,
    this model describes the evolution of the stock market price during a speculative
    bubble. The market dynamic is modeled using a combination of a power law, and
    some decreasing periodic oscillations. The power law in the price is the result
    of the actions of a group of rational, well-informed traders, who invest in a
    speculative bubble because the risk of stock market crash is compensated by the
    returns produced by the acceleration of the price increase. The oscillations are
    produced by the random actions of a group of noise traders, who exhibit some herding
    behavior, for example by being driven away from the rational price by an overreaction
    to the news. The decrease in the oscillation is because when the power law strengthens,
    approaching its final singularity, all the market participants identify the bubble
    and behave as rational traders. Note that such a behavior by market participants
    implies an increasing level of mimicry among traders’ actions while approaching
    the stock market crash.

- en: Anticipation of a financial crisis also often relies on identifying increasing
    correlations among assets composing the markets. Patro et al. ([2013](#CR7)) propose
    a very simple systemic risk indicator by measuring increasing correlations among
    stock returns of banks. This kind of approach has numerous variations, see Silva
    et al. ([2017](#CR9)) for a survey. Some other authors do not restrict their approach
    to identifying correlations among banks. For example, Douady and Kornprobst ([2018](#CR1))
    developed an approach based on the structure of the correlation matrix of the
    stocks defining a market. Zheng et al. ([2012](#CR13)) use an indicator based
    on the link among sectorial sub-components of the market index to predict the
    market itself. Harmon et al. ([2011](#CR3)) show that the internal herding of
    the market can also be captured by co-movement.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But these increasing correlations also appear among the markets themselves,
    which tend to behave as one during a financial crisis (Junior & Franca, [2012](#CR5)).
    This point is especially important, because it highlights the fact that external
    causes also matter, along with internal dynamics. Ye and Douady ([2019](#CR12))
    use 200 external factors to estimate a non-linear polymodel, with successful results
    in deriving a systemic risk indicator. Their indicator is based on the sum among
    elementary models of a goodness of fit indicator, the R². Our approach also relies
    on assessing the links between a stock market index and its environment using
    a non-linear polymodel. However, although our systemic risk indicator is focused
    on the goodness of fit, we do not make any assumptions about how the goodness
    of fit should evolve during a financial crisis. In particular, we do not assume
    that the links between the market and its environment strengthen during the crisis,
    and we will see that this strengthening is only a part of the phenomenon’s characteristics.

    to confront the indicator with its most natural real-world implementation: trying
    to beat the market. The fourth part is dedicated to performing a wide set of robustness

    bias in favor of the equity indices, as the target variables are themselves equities.

    polymodel is estimated on a rolling basis, using a 5-year window. Although the
    data is available at a daily frequency, we only re-perform the estimation each
    month, due to our computational resources. We transform the daily returns in order
    to get some monthly returns,^([3](#Fn3)) which may exhibit clearer patterns. The
    factor set of explanatory variables is lagged by one month, in order to give us
    a clear direction for causality (as a positive side effect, it also makes sure
    that we avoid the use of future information due to the asynchronicity of international
    markets):![$$ \left\{{Y}_t={LNLM}_{i,t}\left({X}_{i,t-1}\right)\kern1em \forall

    the estimation is done for a given date, we compute a goodness of fit indicator,
    the root mean square error, for each of the elementary models that compose the
    polymodel. This indicator captures the strength of the link between a given factor
    and the predicted stock market. In order to remove the most insignificant factors,
    we filter the polymodel to keep only the lowest 80% RMSEs.

    market maintains with its whole economic environment. It is similar to having
    a distribution of the correlations, however, it is a more general representation
    since it allows for the links to be non-linear, thanks to the use of polymodels.
    The foundation of our indicator is the hypothesis that a specific distribution
    of the RMSEs exists before the crisis.
  prefs: []

- en: The distributions of the RMSEs are obtained using a simple kernel density estimation
    (see Parzen, [1962](#CR6); Rosenblatt, [1956](#CR8)). The bandwidth selection
    is done according to Silverman’s rule of thumb (Silverman, [1986](#CR10)).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First, we only select the distributions of RMSEs that are followed by a market
    drawdown in the following 3 months. Our representation of the pre-crisis distribution
    is a rolling average of these distributions, weighted by the square of the 3 months’
    returns that follows (we assume that the larger the following drawdown, the more
    representative the distribution). The rolling average follows an exponential weighting
    scheme, with a half-life of 10 years, that allows us to slightly overweight the
    most recent distributions, while very old representations of the pre-crisis distribution
    are taken into account with less and less importance. Of course, this rolling
    representation is shifted properly so that at each point in time, it does not
    use any future information.

    it is important to make sure that the construction of a robust trading strategy
    is possible based on our Systemic Risk Indicator. Hence, in order to limit the
    risk of arbitrarily picking a window parameter, we recompute the indicator and
    the performance of the strategy using an average of the RMSEs estimated using
    a 6-year, a 5-year, a 4-year, and a 3-year rolling window. Computing the indicator
    using this average RMSE is a simple way to make it more robust to the choice of
    a particular window.

    The improvement of the average is 95%, a figure associated with a *p*-value of
    0.16%. In this version of the strategy, previous figures stay comparable, with
    an average random improvement of −12.63%, an average hedging 35.96% of the time
    within the sample, and 11 stock indexes out of 12 that over-perform the market.
    Ultimately, even diluted by weaker versions of itself, our trading strategy delivers
    strong results (Table [4.10](#Tab10)):Table 4.10

    results of our particular choices of leverage for our trading strategy. Since
    the full sample volatility of the returns is standardized to make the market and
    the trading strategy comparable, what controls the aggressiveness of the strategy
    is the magnitude of the difference between the risk OFF leverage and the risk
    ON leverage, more than the level of the leverage itself. Hence, we try some changes
    of the risk OFF leverage, while keeping the risk ON leverage constantly equal
    to 2.

    significant across several markets and time periods. These results are found to
    be robust in the tests that have been conducted. However, the robustness of the
    strategy, as well as its performance, can be increased by selecting/combining
    better/different parameters of the strategy.

- en: In terms of improving the design of the indicator, it is possible to explore
    different paths. Subject to computational resources, estimating the indicator
    on a daily frequency can be a game changer since the indicator spikes sometimes
    only a few days after the beginning of a market drawdown. The methodology developed
    for the indicator should also be tested to see if it can predict market rallies.
    Indeed, it is possible that some particular herding behavior may occur at the
    beginning of speculative bubbles, for example. If this is the case, it can also
    improve the crisis indicator by differentiating exuberant mimicry from collective
    panic.

    of the indicator. It is especially important to better understand which factors
    correlate or de-correlate the most before the crisis, and why they behave accordingly.

    how it can add value to a portfolio that aims at benefiting from various market
    timing signals (for example, its performance can be compared with other market
    stress indicators, such as Chicago Fed’s National Financial Conditions Index (NFCI)).

    However, as far as we know, at the time of writing, all these indicators are based
    on the increase of correlations. The present chapter adds value to the literature
    by identifying another, simultaneous and possibly stronger phenomenon of de-correlation
    of the factors. Considering the shape of the representative pre-Crisis distributions
    and the results achieved by the Systemic Risk Indicator, this finding may be one
    of the keys to understanding the financial crisis.
