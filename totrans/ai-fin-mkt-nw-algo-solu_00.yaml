- en: 'A series of authored and edited monographs that utilize quantitative and computational
    methods to model, analyze and interpret large-scale social phenomena. Titles within
    the series contain methods and practices that test and develop theories of complex
    social processes through bottom-up modeling of social interactions. Of particular
    interest is the study of the co-evolution of modern communication technology and
    social behavior and norms, in connection with emerging issues such as trust, risk,
    security and privacy in novel socio-technical environments. Computational Social
    Sciences is explicitly transdisciplinary: quantitative methods from fields such
    as dynamical systems, artificial intelligence, network theory, agent-based modeling,
    and statistical mechanics are invoked and combined with state-of-the-art mining
    and analysis of large data sets to help us understand social agents, their interactions
    on and offline, and the effect of these interactions at the macro level. Topics
    include, but are not limited to social networks and media, dynamics of opinions,
    cultures and conflicts, socio-technical co-evolution and social psychology. Computational
    Social Sciences will also publish monographs and selected edited contributions
    from specialized conferences and workshops specifically aimed at communicating
    new findings to a large transdisciplinary audience. A fundamental goal of the
    series is to provide a single forum within which commonalities and differences
    in the workings of this field may be discerned, hence leading to deeper insight
    and understanding.'

- en: 'Financial markets are likely one of the few human achievements that can truly
    be described as complex systems. Complex systems are structures in physics that:
    (a) derive a significant portion of their dynamics from interactions between components,
    (b) the interactions are highly nonlinear and tend to change based on their own
    dynamics (feedback), (c) the system’s behavior cannot be directly attributed to
    a pure sum of the individual interactions: The total is much more than the sum
    of the individual parts, (d) and from this derive two very important consequences:
    a very strong dependence on initial conditions (starting from similar situations,
    we observe completely divergent final states) (a typical example is weather forecasts).'

    dubbed “the oil of the future,” powering a large portion of our socioeconomic
    systems. AI can be found on the Internet, and in applications, we use every day,
    in economic forecasting systems, advertising management systems, and search engines.
    In our cars, games, and, of course, financial markets.

- en: This book is about what happens (and what might happen in the near future) when
    AI technologies become more prevalent in the capital markets. This is a significant
    advancement over, say, high-frequency trading algorithms, which raged unchecked
    in markets (particularly financial derivatives) until a few years ago. These algorithms
    are gradually being supplanted by extremely complex AI technologies capable of
    performing tasks that are deeply integrated with the ecosystem in which markets
    operate (the world of news, or sociopolitical dynamics, the pandemic, geopolitical
    tensions).

    the current financial markets, and what could be the largest socioeconomic policy
    operation ever attempted in history, the so-called Great Reset. Then there are
    the applications, which stem from the use of mixed big data/AI technologies for
    the detection and deactivation of fake news, economic evaluation and prediction
    systems, models based on artificial agents capable of making independent decisions,
    and dynamic opinion models.'
