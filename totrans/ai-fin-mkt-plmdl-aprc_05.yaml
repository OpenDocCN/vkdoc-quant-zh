- en: We present a new factor predicting the cross-section of industry returns on
    the stock market. The factor is based on a measure of antifragility, pointing
    out that the non-linearity of the link between market and industry returns is
    priced by market participants. It is shown to differ from other well-known industry
    factors, including downside beta and coskewness factors, which are entirely subsumed
    by the antifragility factor. A trading strategy derived from the factor exhibits
    a Sharpe ratio of 1.10, and successfully resists various robustness tests.

- en: Since Fama and French ([1993](#CR7)), there has been a long tradition of identifying
    factors which explain the cross-section of stock returns. However, only a few
    papers tackle the problem of predicting the cross-section of industry returns,
    one of the most famous examples being Asness et al. ([2000](#CR2)). In the current
    chapter, we thus add to the literature on this particular topic.

- en: We measure market antifragility as the convexity of the non-linear response
    of the industry return to a market shock. The economic rationale that underlies
    the performance of the antifragility factor can be seen evenly from both the behavioral
    and classical financial approach of the efficient markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Seen from the efficient markets hypothesis, the antifragility factor can be
    interpreted as a risk premium. The portfolio built using the antifragility signal
    takes long positions on fragile industries and short positions on anti-fragile
    industries. Hence, for extreme market events, the portfolio suffers from its concave
    position on the industries, especially since its losses accelerate with the magnitude
    of the market move. Since such events occur with a low probability, the resulting
    behavior of the portfolio would be some punctual crashes. These drawdowns are
    clearly identifiable in the P&L curve of the simulation. Thus, the persistent
    abnormal returns of the fragile industries may be seen as a compensation for the
    extreme risk that they carry, i.e. as a risk premium.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The antifragility factor may also be justified from the behavioral finance point
    of view. Indeed, we may consider that fragile industries constitute an investment
    opportunity just because investors over-buy the antifragile industries. Such a
    behavior would be strongly consistent with a loss-aversion bias of investors who
    would prefer to buy anti-fragile industries at a very high (too high) price than
    bear the risk of enduring extreme losses.

- en: The low beta anomaly, as presented for example in Baker et al. ([2011](#CR3)),
    is a well-known predictor of the cross-section of stock returns. Low beta refers
    to the parameter estimated in a linear model with the stock returns as target
    variable and market returns as explanatory variable. In the long run, low-beta
    (and low-vol) stocks outperform the high-beta (high-vol) stocks. Such a phenomenon
    is more in line with a market anomaly than with a risk premia explanation, since
    the riskier stocks perform the worst. This is exactly the opposite of what we
    observe with our antifragility risk measure, which does not make the low beta
    anomaly a very promising candidate to explain it. Nevertheless, since the beta
    is the first derivative of a linear model while the antifragility is the average
    second derivative of a non-linear model, we should control for it.

- en: 'The downside beta, as presented by Ang et al. ([2006](#CR1)), is a risk measure
    designed to capture downside risk. It refers to a market beta estimated as:![$$
    {\beta}^{-}=\frac{\mathit{\operatorname{cov}}\ \left({r}_a,{r}_m|{r}_m&lt;{\overline{r}}_m\right)}{\mathit{\operatorname{var}}\
    \left({r}_m|{r}_m&lt;{\overline{r}}_m\right)} $$](../images/519851_1_En_5_Chapter/519851_1_En_5_Chapter_TeX_Equ1.png)(5.1)*Here
    r*[*a*] *is the return of a given stock a, r*[*m*] *is the return of the market,
    and* ![$$ {\overline{r}}_m $$](../images/519851_1_En_5_Chapter/519851_1_En_5_Chapter_TeX_IEq1.png)
    *is the average return of the market.*So, it is simply a beta evaluated while
    only taking into account the bearish returns of the market. Such a metric is by
    nature highly correlated with the simple market beta, which pushed Ang and colleagues
    to introduce a relative downside beta, which is the metric we focus on below:![$$
    {\beta}^{relative}={\beta}^{-}-\beta . $$](../images/519851_1_En_5_Chapter/519851_1_En_5_Chapter_TeX_Equ2.png)(5.2)In
    the paper, the relative downside beta is a risk premium: stocks having a high
    downside beta are associated with high future returns to compensate the risk of
    holding the stock. Such a behavior can be explained by loss aversion, and goes
    in the same direction as the antifragility anomaly.The coskewness is another measure
    of the market risk of a given stock, more focused on extreme events, such as antifragility.
    It can be defined as:![$$ coskew=\frac{E\left[\left({r}_a-{\overline{r}}_a\right){\left({r}_m-{\overline{r}}_m\right)}^2\right]}{\sqrt{\mathit{\operatorname{var}}\
    \left({r}_a\right)}\mathit{\operatorname{var}}\ \left({r}_m\right)}. $$](../images/519851_1_En_5_Chapter/519851_1_En_5_Chapter_TeX_Equ3.png)(5.3)Harvey
    and Siddique ([2000](#CR10)) already proposed coskewness as a risk premium. We
    thus control that we are not proposing a variation of this risk factor.'

    of stock returns, the underlying rationale seems applicable to explain the cross-section
    of industry returns. We thus benchmark and stress the antifragility anomaly with
    these other predictors in order to control for the reality of our contribution
    to the literature. Indeed, the antifragility anomaly seems to be stronger than
    any other anomaly that has previously been identified in the literature, at least
    in relation to the particular question of the industry returns.

    of variation), leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility (or
    variability, stress, dispersion of outcomes, or uncertainty, what is grouped under

    a part of the large literature dedicated to factor investing. Indeed, this literature
    reveals that the cross-section of stock returns is highly multidimensional. The
    interested reader may refer to Green et al. ([2014](#CR8)) and Hou et al. ([2017](#CR11))
    for an exhaustive review of the existing factors. Again, several publications
    point out that factor investing is also possible among industries, by taking long
    positions on some industries and short on others to form a portfolio (e.g. Asness
    ([2000](#CR2))).

- en: We measure the antifragility using the AntiFragility Indicator (AFI) as defined
    in Section [5.3.1](#Sec5). A key question in order to describe antifragility in
    a particular context is to define what the object of analysis is sensitive to.
    The market is a convenient and natural choice, since it may be the first vector
    of shocks that interact with industries. Even if we only have access to daily
    data, we try to identify low-frequency response of industries, using 21-day cumulative
    returns re-computed every day for the LNLM estimations. This allows us to see
    how the industries react over the month during bearish and bullish markets. For
    the question of robustness, we use a very large rolling window of 5 years, allowing
    1,260 points for each fit (monthly returns are recomputed on a daily basis). For
    computational reasons, we only re-compute the AFI every 3 months.

    investment universe, we keep it in the industry bucket used to compute AFI even
    after it exits the investment universe. This allows us to get more representative
    industry returns, even if we then only partially bet on them, since we restrict
    our positions to the investment universe.

    AFI signal. At each date, we sort the industries by their AFI in descending order,
    and we normalize the ranked signal obtained to be uniformly distributed between
    −1 and 1\. Indeed, we are only interested in measuring the impact of the relative
    industry antifragility on future returns, and having an average of 0 for the signal
    allows us to partly neutralize the market as a source of portfolio returns. Such
    a procedure of ranking and normalization is straightforward in factor investing
    strategies (see for example Chan et al., [1998](#CR5), or Coqueret and Guida,
    [2018](#CR6)). For convenience, in the following we use the initialism “AFI” to

    antifragility factor is able to add value on top of classical factors. In order
    to do so, we compute the P&L of characteristic portfolios of common factors, using
    exactly the same methodology as for the L/S strategy, and use it to attempt to
    explain the returns of the antifragility portfolio.

    The value is computed as the book to market ratio defined as net assets (assets
    minus liabilities) divided by current market capitalization. We aggregate the
    stock level signal simply by averaging it inside of each industry. The size signal
    is minus the log of the market cap. We aggregate by taking the sum of the stock
    level signals.

- en: In a third regression, we include the market portfolio returns, as well as a
    Low Beta portfolio, a Momentum portfolio, a Downside Beta portfolio, and a Coskewness
    portfolio. The motivation to add these statistical factors is that we suspect
    that they are linked to the antifragility factor, since they are computed using
    the same data, namely the returns. This reasoning is especially appropriate for
    Low Beta, since a very curvy shape of our fits may be approximated by a steep
    line. As explained in the introduction of the chapter, Downside Beta and Coskewness
    are also particularly relevant candidates to explain the returns of the antifragility
    anomaly. The Momentum signal is computed following the classical methodology of
    computing the 11-month return lagged by 1 month (Carhart ([1997](#CR4)), see also
    Jegadeesh and Titman ([1993](#CR12))). We directly use the returns of our industry
    buckets here. The Low Beta is computed as the parameter of a simple univariate
    regression of the daily industry returns on the market (including a constant),
    using a 1 year rolling window. Downside Beta is computed using the formula presented
    in the introduction (to be perfectly precise, we continue to consider the relative
    downside beta), as well as Coskewness.

    significant constant below 0.2% of *p*-value. The constant is also economically
    significant, and corresponds to an abnormal annual return of around 17% in the
    last regression (without compounding, without volatility standardization before
    regression). Such a level of abnormal returns depends of course on the leverage
    and the volatility. The R² of the third regression being 30.3%, and the Sharpe
    ratio of the strategy being 1.10, we may expect the abnormal returns to be around
    11% * (1−0.303) = 7.67% for a 10% realized volatility, which stays economically
    significant.

    not just driven by one of these two characteristics of the impact function. Convexity
    reflects the antifragility of the industries, i.e. their ability to perform extremely
    well when there is an extreme market deviation. Concavity, on the other hand,
    truly captures their extreme risk, as a non-linear concave response would lead
    to dramatic losses. Hence controlling for concavity and convexity effects is equivalent
    to controlling for the importance of the propensity of the industries to lose
    and for their propensity to win.

    trading a quarter after its optimization would make profits. This is not too surprising
    since the AntiFragility Indicator is very stable because of the 5-year rolling
    window used for its computation. It moderates the concerns we may have about the
    impact of re-computing the AFI only every 63 days. This point is further confirmed
    by the high daily autocorrelation of the score, which is 99.84%. The autocorrelation
    of the current score to its 21-day lag is thus still 97.07%.

    on which they are based and the stability of the performance. While this stability
    may indicate that the strategy is easily tradable, it is also associated with
    a risk of “cherry picking” of the industries at the beginning of the trading period.
    Indeed, we may randomly create a portfolio that simply picks the good industries
    at the beginning of the simulation and holds them for the duration of the full
    simulation, while this is clearly less likely to happen if the sign (long/short)
    of the holdings changes frequently over time. Below we give the summary statistics

- en: 'Here, while we can still observe a sensitivity of the Sharpe ratio to the hyper-parameter,
    we find again a strong robustness of the signal performance. Very interestingly,
    the signal computed with derivatives between +1% and −1% still deliver significant
    performance, despite the fact that this domain is very small, considering that
    we are working with 21-day cumulative returns. This point highlights the importance
    of the choice we made in the definition of the AFI. Since we approximated the
    probability weighted integral by a sum of *regularly* spaced derivatives, we indirectly
    assumed a uniform distribution for the associated probabilities. The tightening
    of the domains of derivatives thus shows that the central derivatives matter a
    lot for the performance, while the extremes may be less important. Assuming a
    bell distribution for the market returns, one may understand this as a reflection
    of the probabilities of the derivatives: what occurs less often simply matters
    less. Further research may try to weight the approximated AFI by the probability
    distribution of market returns.'

    we seeded the generator that randomly selects the observations which belong to
    each fold in the computation of μ. This practice makes it possible to replicate
    the results. If we used the default seed,^([9](#Fn9)) we still need to control
    that the choice of a particular set of random draws hadn’t led to a spuriously
    high level of performance.

    that the simulations are very weakly sensitive to the choice of a particular seed

    weights, at the stock level and at the industry level.^([11](#Fn11)) This last
    test is performed as a sanity check that indicates if the outputs of the characteristic
    portfolio methodology really reflect its inputs. The Pearson correlation between
    the AFI and optimized weights is 81.17% at the stock level and 87.13% at the industry
    level. We also computed the Spearman correlation, as in our case the ranking is
    more important than the precise levels (since the optimization process minimizes
    the variance, we may expect slightly different weights for a same level of score).
    The Spearman correlation between the AFI and optimized weights is 91.54% at the
    stock level and 93.14% at the industry level.

- en: The present chapter proposes an original approach to predict the industry returns
    on the stock market. Once again, it emphasizes the fact that the multi-dimensionality
    of the cross-section of stock returns is still a wide territory to explore for
    the literature. The emergence of alternative data is a promising path for this
    journey, but it should not mask the need for an improvement to the modeling methodologies.

- en: In particular, using very common data (stock returns only), the present chapter
    demonstrates that the standard linear modeling approaches would have failed to
    capture the subtlety of the reality. Non-linear modeling matters, and its utility
    is not restricted to tail modeling, since antifragility is also priced in the
    center of the distribution. This application of the LNLM model also gives insights
    about its efficiency and ability to reflect true relations between target and
    explanatory variables.

- en: A lot of research questions emerge from this chapter. Considering the tests
    performed, our results seem robust, and show the high importance of the antifragility
    factor to explain the cross-section of industry returns. This level of importance
    in the prediction of future returns should be confirmed using other datasets and/or
    alternative antifragility measures. The computation of the AFI itself should be
    improved by the weighting of the second derivatives’ probabilities.

    links between the antifragility factor and well-known factors. Their interactions
    should be studied, evenly from an economics or statistical point of view.

- en: Finally, antifragility subsumes Downside Beta and Coskewness in our study. This
    finding should be studied directly in the cross-section of stock returns, for
    which it can significantly improve the existing knowledge on risk premia.
