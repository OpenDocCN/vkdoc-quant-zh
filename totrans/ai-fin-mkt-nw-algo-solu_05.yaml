- en: 'We propose one example of application that could have a large impact on our
    economies: the use of artificial agents to reproduce dynamics, case study the
    spreading of fake news. It is known that a large number of applications (some
    described here) are dedicated to investing in financial markets by observing the
    prevailing trends, often carrying out operations at very high speed. These applications
    often cause problems by accelerating downtrends irrationally. The markets are
    running for cover against this type of problem. But automatic traders are emerging
    who are able to evaluate not the trends but directly the news that alone is at
    the origin of the trends themselves. This poses the following problem: if cultural
    diffusion (in this case news, but it could be posts on social networks, little
    changes) is made problematic by the appearance of ‘fake.news’, how can we be calm
    about the functioning of our automatic traders? Here we propose a completely new
    approach to this problem, which makes use of a widespread AI technology, artificial
    agents. These agents reproduce the phenomenon of spreading fake news and give
    indications on how to fight it (Chen and Freire in Discovering and measuring malicious
    URL redirection campaigns from fake news domains, pp. 1–6, [2021](#CR1); Garg
    et al. in Replaying archived twitter: when your bird is broken, will it bring
    you down? pp. 160–169, [2021](#CR3); Mahesh et al. in Identification of Fake News
    Using Deep Learning Architecture, pp. 1246–1253, [2021](#CR7)).'

- en: The sociological literature relating to the dynamics of diffusion and consolidation
    of culture is very extensive. Here we have chosen to start from the concept of
    culture defined by Axelrod who sees the dissemination of culture as the output
    of a process of reciprocal influence between social actors who share specific
    values and distinctive traits. In fact, similar agents will tend to prefer interaction
    between them and consequently a circle of homophilia growth is created between
    them. In this context, the process of interaction between agents plays a fundamental
    role.

    daily behavior of social actors to the point of co-occurring in the determination
    of their own identity. In the collective dimension, the role of social media is
    fundamental in determining collaborative digital networks that can be “weak” and
    instantaneous like affinity networks but can also structure themselves to the
    point of constituting themselves as real social groups.

    such importance that the consumer is not only a user of messages and contents
    but also becomes their producer and editor, generating a continuous circle of

    who is the producer (producer) and user (consumer) of the media product. The term
    prosumer was coined in 1980 by the American sociologist Toffler already in 1975
    by Jean Cloutier had elaborated a similar idealtype defining it self-media, in
    both cases we refer to the ability of the subject to be producer and user in a
    contemporary way of cultural and media products.

    figure but rather defines any user of the network. Since each digital actor is
    also a content producer, in particular a data producer. The action of producing
    a digital content within the web space, in fact, is not necessarily limited to
    the creation of a specific online multimedia content (post, video, image) it also
    concerns simpler and apparently low communicative activities such as for example
    share or retweet content, insert a like or geolocate yourself in a specific place.

    articles are shared by Facebook pages forming a bubble of news from unofficial
    sources. In particular, it was coded a simulative model based on artificial agents.
    The agents are articles, social pages, websites and users; these interacting with
    each other make up the pages-to-articles network (‘pages to articles’ network,
    pta network), which is the focus of our investigation (Gupta and Potika [2021](#CR5);
