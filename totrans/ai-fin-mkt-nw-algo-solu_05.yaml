    economies: the use of artificial agents to reproduce dynamics, case study the
    spreading of fake news. It is known that a large number of applications (some
    described here) are dedicated to investing in financial markets by observing the
    prevailing trends, often carrying out operations at very high speed. These applications
    often cause problems by accelerating downtrends irrationally. The markets are
    running for cover against this type of problem. But automatic traders are emerging
    who are able to evaluate not the trends but directly the news that alone is at
    the origin of the trends themselves. This poses the following problem: if cultural
    diffusion (in this case news, but it could be posts on social networks, little
    changes) is made problematic by the appearance of ‘fake.news’, how can we be calm
    about the functioning of our automatic traders? Here we propose a completely new
    approach to this problem, which makes use of a widespread AI technology, artificial
    agents. These agents reproduce the phenomenon of spreading fake news and give
    indications on how to fight it (Chen and Freire in Discovering and measuring malicious
    URL redirection campaigns from fake news domains, pp. 1–6, [2021](#CR1); Garg
    et al. in Replaying archived twitter: when your bird is broken, will it bring
    you down? pp. 160–169, [2021](#CR3); Mahesh et al. in Identification of Fake News
    Using Deep Learning Architecture, pp. 1246–1253, [2021](#CR7)).'

    culture defined by Axelrod who sees the dissemination of culture as the output
    of a process of reciprocal influence between social actors who share specific
    values and distinctive traits. In fact, similar agents will tend to prefer interaction
    between them and consequently a circle of homophilia growth is created between
    them. In this context, the process of interaction between agents plays a fundamental
    role.
