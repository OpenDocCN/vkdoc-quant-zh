- en: Traditional economic theories struggle to explain financial market volatility
    and the macroeconomy. Traders seldom assume the role of rational optimizers, as
    described in standard economic models, in financial markets. Boom and bust cycles
    are widespread, as are firm values based purely on the flashy personalities of
    CEOs, reckless speculators, and a general sense of irrationality. Clearly, this
    is not enough to condemn old economic theories as “useless.” In reality, knowing
    that human behavior leads in self-regulating, stable markets where prices never
    deviate too far from equilibrium can provide exciting and practical outcomes Instead
    of evaluating the financial system as a whole and modeling it from the top down,
    one might examine its agents and see if system-wide characteristics emerge from
    their interaction. This is extensively used to investigate so-called Complex Systems,
    which exhibit significant non-linearity and unstable equilibrium states that are
    easily disrupted by little shocks. Traditional economic theories are effective
    in illustrating a relatively narrow system state, namely one in which the market
    is in equilibrium. Alternative techniques, however, backed by complex system theory,
    may allow for the portrayal of a more generic model in which equilibrium states
    are a subfield of a larger model. ABM is a valuable approach for simulating complex
    systems. Bottom-up modeling does not need scientists to approximate the entire
    system to a differential equation. They could instead mimic the interactions of
    the system’s single agents. If the agents’ behavioral assumption is right, shared
    behaviors should “emerge” in the system.

    I’m currently studying at the University of Siena’s Department of Information
    Science, majoring in the topic of Complex Systems. In the scientific world, my
    objective is to use Agent Based Modelling and Artificial Intelligence to get significant
    insights into Complex Systems. I feel that studying Emergent Phenomena and Systems
    Dynamics is vital for making sound decisions. While studying on my Doctorate,
    I work as a Project Manager in a variety of industries, including Real Estate

    market fluctuations and how they relate to the macroeconomy (LeBaron [2000](#CR1)).
    In the financial markets, traders seldom ever play the part of the rational optimizers
    that are frequently depicted in traditional economic models, in fact is not uncommon
    to observe boom and bust cycles, company valuations depending only on the glitzy
    personalities of CEOs, reckless speculators, and a great deal of irrationality
    overall.

    in fact thinking that human behavior results in self-regulating, stable marketplaces
    where prices never stray too far from equilibrium, can yield interesting and realistic

    system as a whole, and model it using a top-down approach, one might think to
    study it by understanding the agents populating the system and observe if properties
    common to the system emerge from their interaction. This is often the approach
    used to study the so-called Complex Systems, i.e., systems exhibiting high degrees
    of non-linearity, in which equilibrium states are unstable and small perturbations
    easily disrupts them.'

    a very specific system state, namely one in which the market is in equilibrium,
    alternative approaches, supported by the theory of complex systems, may enable
    the illustration of a more general model in which the specific instances of equilibrium
    states are a subfield of broader model.

    this type of modelling, the bottom-up approach is king and scientists don’t have
    to concern themselves with approximating the whole system to a differential equation.
    Instead, they may concentrate their efforts on simulating the interactions of
    the single agents that are intended to exist in the system. If the behavioural
    hypothesis upon which the agents have been created is sound, one expects to see
    the “emergence” of behaviours that are shared by the entire system.

    how a single atom or molecule of the gas behaves when it exchanges heat, modify
    is quantity of movement or gets hit by another atom of the gas. Then you use a
    computer to simulate all these interaction among atoms and other atoms and atoms
    and the environment. If you did a good job the results emerging will be coherent
    with the Gay-Lussac’s law even though you could have known nothing about the balloon
    as a whole.

    and unnecessarily complicated to use such approach. However, there are many circumstances
    when it might be difficult, if not impossible, to use conventional mathematical
    models. When dealing with a large number of equations and several heterogeneous
    variables with a lot of indices, mathematical models are often not particularly
    effective.

    and iterative processes. In particular when parts of the system interact frequently
    among each other’s leading to the emergence of important features, to understand
    the system is then usually very hard to implement traditional mathematical models.
    What I just wrote is not entirely accurate, what would be accurate is to say that
    when the system as whole cannot be analyzed clearly by the scientists trying to
    describe it, then it’s very hard to implement traditional models. When a bird’s
    eye view is not possible, like in the case of societies or economies where even
    the people studying the system are part of it, then it’s useful to try using an
    ABM process, starting from the bottom, from what we can understand and describe
    in a stylized way for the purpose of a simulation. This is the true power of ABM.
    To use another metaphor, it’s much easier to describe an ant, a very simple living
    organism, then to describe the entire ants’ nest, whose behavior cannot be comprehended
    by simply describing that of a single ant. However, harnessing the power of simulation
    is possible, by setting simple behavioral rules for the single ant, describe the
    whole nest.

    expectations based on the assumption that they have full understanding of the

    rational agent is substituted by one with bounded rationality (Simon [1997](#CR3)),
    able to infer about the markets thanks to a combination of behavioural rules and
    heuristics. In fact, we can use agents’ modelling types to classify different
    modelling approaches:'

    and that their behavioural rules are extremely simple. The point of these type
    of models is to observe if features actually present in real financial markets
    can emerge from the system’s structure. A very good example of this is the model
    developed by Farmer et al. ([2005](#CR4)). The authors take the notion of a non-rational
    agent to its final extreme, creating agents that are completely devoid of rationality.
    In the model the agents simply place orders randomly (precisely orders arrive
    as a Poisson random process) and participate to a continuous double auction, i.e.,
    they can place buy or sell orders at any time they want. Therefore, the model
    drops any ambition of describing market strategies or human behaviour and instead
    focuses mostly on characterising the limitations that the continuous double auction
    imposes on the system. The sole difference between agents is how frequently they
    place orders: impatient agents will be forced to place a fixed number of orders
    per unit time, whereas patient agents will put orders at random, not just for
    pricing but also for time. The authors then compared and evaluated their findings
    against real data from the London Stock Exchange Market, explaining approximately
    96% of the spread and 75% of the variance in the price diffusion rate using a
    single free parameter.'

    this case the simplest possible, on the behaviour of the agents it’s possible
    to reproduce market’s and prices’ features by focussing the modelling attention
    on how the agents actually interact (continuous double auction).

    of being chartists. Given the rational assumption the only possibility for the
    stock trader is to be a fundamentalist always trying to discover the real valuation
    of a stock and trade consequently.

    it’s possible to include as many behavioural rules as wanted. Within this framework
    traders can pursue different strategies and react differently to signals, either
    from the market or from other agents. Iori and Porter ([2012](#CR2)) differentiate
    between heterogenous agents whose interaction is mediated by the market and those
    who can interact directly among each other’s. The latter type can has been useful
    to explain herding behaviour in finance (Hirshleifer and Slew [2003](#CR5)), while
    the former has been useful to understand the role of learning (LeBaron [2000](#CR6)).

    similar behaviour. In a genuine market, this may include institutional and retail
    investors or algorithmic and manual traders, to name a few examples. The groups

    over time. These behaviours emerge spontaneously only through the two mechanisms
    of adaptation available to the agents, i.e., learning and imitation. Now we will

    methodologies. They do a fundamental examination of the stock, simulating the
    act of investigating the worth of the underlying corporation that issued the shares,
    and consequently price the stock. They will also do a trend analysis, focusing
    solely on the previous performance of the stock while neglecting the underlying
    asset. The sequence in which these two pricing methods are executed is unimportant.
    Then, they will weigh the two acquired prices based on their current market outlook,
    or whether they feel it is preferable to be “fundamentalists” or “chartists.”
    In addition, the price will be affected by how greedy or fearful market participants
    are at the moment. Finally, following these analyses, they will determine which
    stocks to sell or purchase and in what quantities.

    is a sell) or a sell (if the order is a buy) order that matches the desired price
    and quantity, beginning with the oldest order issued. Price and quantity do not
    need to be identical; an agent might purchase fewer stocks at a cheaper price
    than he initially desired and then purchase the remainder from another agent.
    The day concludes when all orders that might be fulfilled have been finished.
    Then the agents will learn, which entails upgrading their decision-making heuristics
    depending on whether they are better off than before and how they may have been
    had they made other judgments. They will then emulate agents with whom they are
    associated who are wealthier than they are, adjusting their heuristics appropriately.
    Every two weeks, the fundamental value of the stock will vary by a modest proportion.
    This is done to imitate actual changes in the assets of the underlying firms.
    Average stock prices and other agents’ fundamental properties will be preserved.

- en: When looking at the mean value of both decisional parameters (Truesight and
    Trendsight), we observed that in certain moments the population prefers to follow
    a pricing strategy where the fundamental value (truevalue) of a stock has more
    weight in the decision process than the trend (trendvalue) and vice versa. This
    is equivalent to say that there is no convergence when it comes to the strategy
    adopted. However, this phenomenon completely disappears when we inhibit either
    one among the imitation or the learning mechanism. This led us to think that to
    obtain non trivial model, where we can observe the emergence of types of investors,
    we need both mechanisms working at the same time.

    the time series of the behavioural parameters. We found that there are 3 main
    distinct behavioural clusters over time, this was the objective of the whole simulation,
    finding dynamic types of investors. Translated into the real world, it is like
    to identify groups of investors who react similarly to changes in the market in
    which they participate by interacting (imitation mechanism) and by changing their
    strategy based on previous performance (learning mechanism).

- en: ABM is a powerful and innovative tool which ideal use is to tackle problems
    hard to face with a top-down approach. Thinking about financial markets as complex
    systems makes them an obvious area of application for ABM. However, unlike ML,
    which already shows promising real world applications, ABM for now seems providing
    most of its results in the academic world, especially to describe social phenomena
    happening in the markets. This leads us to think that we are still at an early
    stage for this modelling technique, thus there is plenty of room for improvement
    and innovation. Our model was on the same line. A very early stage research on
    investors dynamic clustering and on the role of imitation and learning in the
    modelling of financial markets.

    it’s usefulness is undeniable, and the financial world can only benefit from it.
