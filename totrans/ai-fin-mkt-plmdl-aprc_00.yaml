- en: This book exposes a manageable approach to exploit nonlinearity for the purpose
    of financial investment. It summarizes the research Raphael Douady and co-authors
    have conducted for nearly two decades now. This research is expanded on multiple
    aspects by a joint work conducted by Thomas Barrau.

- en: In general, relationships between variables are nonlinear and noisy. When attempting
    to relate a target variable to several explanatory variables, modeling finely
    multi-dimensional linearity suffers from the curse of dimensionality without bringing
    blatant benefits. Polymodels simplify this approach by retaining unidimensional
    nonlinearities and proposing various aggregation methods according to the task
    at hand. For instance, in the case of prediction, each one-dimensional model produces
    a prediction. The most relevant ones are then selected, then possibly averaged
    in case of ambiguity, to yield the final prediction. In the case of defining a
    risk indicator, as downturns are usually associated with an increase of correlations,
    the distribution of goodness-of-fit metrics is analyzed. It can be seen as a form
    of ensemble learning.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first task is to perform the one-dimensional nonlinear regressions. Several
    methods are presented, including non-parametric kernel regressions but the method
    of choice is linear regression on nonlinear functions (Hermite polynomials for
    their orthogonality properties) of the explanatory variable, further regularized
    by shrinkage to the linear component to mitigate overfitting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nonlinear transforms of initial factors can be used as new variables or features
    to feed a machine learning algorithm. Another use of extracted nonlinearities
    is to transform their convexity into an antifragility score (in the sense of N.N.
    Taleb). These scores can then be used as a factor to build long-short portfolios.
    The Polymodel approach can be implemented at the level of the market, industries,
    or individual stocks. With the help of Bayesian conditioning it can combine the
    information of hundreds of factors.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In summary, polymodels provide a very workable methodology to exploit nonlinearity
    for the purpose of investing, forecasting and risk management. Barrau and Douady
    describe the method and its application in this book filled with examples and
    backtests which will certainly inspire numerous finance practitioners.

    Soon after we started the Riskdata venture, a new risk software aimed at the buy-side,
    the Twin Towers in New York were hit. This event would change the face of the
    world, and seriously put our nascent project at stake. There was no chance to
    sign a single contract for at least a year. While we were about to abandon the
    project and find a payroll job, a fund of hedge fund manager proposed the following
    challenge to us: *given* only *audited monthly returns of the funds, what can
    we reliably say about their strategy, their risks, and how they fit in a portfolio,
    made of both liquid and alternative assets?*'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'This challenge was way beyond the mere assessment of classical performance
    metrics, such as the Sharpe ratio, downside volatility, beta, Fama–French factor
    analysis, etc. These measures, widely used by the industry, are known to provide
    relevant information from the past, but nothing truly reliable for the future
    behavior. We figured out that, if a software, however sophisticated, ignores the
    key points addressed in a conversation between an investor and a manager, it would
    miss the elephant in the room. So, we asked this manager to let us silently attend
    some of his meetings with the managers he was either invested in or planning to.
    To our surprise, the investor would spend only a few minutes talking about correlations
    and volatility, then the rest of the hour on specific moments that were relevant
    to the particular strategy: how did the manager weather such or such an event?;
    when and how did he flip his positions?; and other such questions. Our challenge
    was to put these questions into a software that was systematic enough to automatically
    address them. The idea was *not* to strictly reproduce the questions, as the answers
    would not explicitly be in the fund returns, but to create a statistical framework
    that would, mechanically, provide the best answers, given the returns information.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The solution had to incorporate the financial environment in which the fund
    evolves. A return, in itself, is not highly informative. It only becomes so when
    related to the rest of the market. The first question to address is: which market
    factors are statistically related to the fund, and how? Note that here, the range
    of possible factors can be extremely broad if we don’t want to miss major risks.
    A multilinear regression on just a few factors would definitely not address the
    issue. The second observation is that unusually large events bear most of the
    information. Extrapolating from the correlation of small events is limited and
    prone to surprises from threshold effects.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Then another aspect of the challenge popped up: how can we make such a specific
    analysis comparable across the various funds, in order to get a full vision of
    the portfolio risks? The portfolio may contain hundreds of investment lines. Its
    risk can be due to the blow up of one particular investment with too large a weight,
    or, more severely, to the unexpected joint loss of a large portion of the portfolio,
    which we could call *vanishing diversification* upon some particular event.'

- en: The *polymodel* approach naturally emerged as the only possible solution to
    this problem. Traditional multifactor analysis first seeks a set of relevant factors
    for each fund, then evaluates the importance of each factor and its “coefficient
    of impact” (the *factor loadings*). Correlation breaks and change of regimes are
    separately addressed, often in a very rudimentary manner, and rarely in their
    systematicity. The *polymodel* approach, on the contrary, first looks at the impact
    of each single factor on all the components of the portfolio, taking into account
    systematic correlation breaks through a non-linear model, then, and only then,
    aggregates the single factor information to answer such questions as the global
    portfolio risks or the contribution of a particular line in the portfolio.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'One can view this analysis as a gigantic automatic generator of stress tests.
    Instead of characterizing each fund and the entire portfolio as a proxy made of
    a combination of risk factors, it represents each asset, each fund, and the portfolio
    itself, by its list of responses to all these stress tests, each being identified
    by a factor shift. Effects of vanishing diversification, for instance, are particularly
    well anticipated, since we know that, for instance, under a sudden surge in interest
    rates, all asset classes will be impacted: equities, credit spreads, etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are aware that no statistical method escapes the fact that it is based on
    the past and that the future has surprises in store for us. But the room left
    for surprises by *polymodels* is definitely much narrower than that left by traditional
    linear multifactor analysis.

- en: 'After successfully applying the *polymodel* approach to portfolios of hedge
    funds, major crises, such as the 2007 Subprime Crisis and the 2008 Global Financial
    Crisis, made it obvious that this non-linear approach was relevant beyond the
    hedge funds universe, to the entire investment space: liquid investments (equities,
    fixed-income, derivatives…), private equity, real estate, etc. We also figured
    out that, beyond a simple risk/return analysis, the richness of *polymodels* allowed
    us to answer a much broader range of questions, such as the anticipated behavior
    of a manager in a liquidity crisis, strategy and style drift, the impact of macroeconomic
    conditions on financial markets, crisis prediction, etc. This book contains methods
    to address several of these questions.'
  prefs: []

- en: Changes of regime and correlation breaks systematically occur upon large events.
    In our view, a sound mathematical model must include any observed systematic phenomenon.
    In short, the mathematics should fit reality, and not the opposite. In this regard,
    like any other artificial intelligence method, *polymodels* first seek to bring
    effective solutions to empirical problems.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The organization of the present book naturally results from this aim, as it
    is structured around the idea of solving an empirical problem. As the most generic
    problem of finance is the prediction of the financial markets, this is the issue
    that we chose to approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, we propose a simple model of the returns of a portfolio invested
    in the stock market, decomposed into market, industry and specific returns. We
    make predictions of these three different components using various techniques,
    all based on non-linear modeling done with polymodels. Empirical applications
    are complemented by a theoretical introduction to Polymodel Theory, and we propose
    pragmatic solutions to the various challenges it raises. We finally aggregate
    the predictions through a genetic algorithm, and the predictive power of the combined
    forecast is assessed by the simulation of a trading strategy. The portfolio obtained
    reaches more than twice the Sharpe ratio of the market, after transaction costs.

- en: Although the primary aim of the present book was to support a doctoral thesis,
    it became clear during its redaction that its interest was far beyond this purpose.
    Being oriented to deliver applications while being simultaneously solidly grounded
    by a self-contained theoretical presentation of *polymodels*, the book is a turnkey
    manual to approach financial markets with artificial intelligence. It is a suitable
    handbook for the practitioner, as it proposes novel and concrete solutions to
    solve real-world problems. Thus, the book will be of interest to machine learners
    searching for new prediction algorithms, quantitative traders looking for original
    strategies, risk managers trying to avoid drawdowns, and portfolio managers dealing
    with the question of the combination of several trading strategies.
