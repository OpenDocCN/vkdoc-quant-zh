- en: As polymodels are introduced as an artificial intelligence technique for the
    prediction of financial markets, we begin the book by presenting a simple framework
    to produce these predictions. We start with a concise literature review on the
    prediction of stock returns. A simple model is then presented, and we explain
    how contributing to the model actually coincides with contributing to the literature.
    We finally develop the plan of the book, which answers each of the different points
    evocated about the literature of financial market prediction.

- en: The possibility of making predictions of financial markets was first suggested
    by Bachelier ([1900](#CR4)), who used a random walk to model the price changes
    of commodities and stocks. The modeling of financial markets following a random
    walk implies the validity of the efficient market hypothesis (see Samuelson, [1965](#CR24)),
    which states that asset prices reflect all available information, leading to the
    impossibility of predicting price changes (Fama, [1965](#CR9)). These seminal
    works, undisputed at the time, are now partly invalidated by a large literature
    coming from different fields such as economics, applied mathematics, and the econophysics
    of psychology, which tackle the question of the prediction of financial markets
    from various different angles.

    market” consistently, perhaps the most obvious one is to simply predict the returns
    of a given stock index.

    the market returns. Although their studies may suffer from some form of overfitting,
    Rapach et al. ([2010](#CR22)) showed that combinations of the forecasts made by
    these variables make it possible to consistently predict the market. Furthermore,
    their results are based on out-of-sample data, thus pointing to the structural
    stability of the macroeconomic roots of the equity premium. In a following study
    (Neely et al., [2014](#CR19)), this macroeconomic approach is completed by the
    use of technical indicators based on trend, momentum and volume.

    crashes. Following a physics-inspired approach,^([1](#Fn1)) Sornette developed
    a model based on the identification of a power law trend in the prices, inevitably
    leading to an unsustainable bubble, and thus, a crash (Johansen et al., [2000](#CR17);
    Sornette, [2009](#CR25)). Market crashes have also been predicted using a variety
    of correlation-based methods (see for example Patro et al., [2013](#CR21); Zheng

    of the variance of each stock return. It has been shown that the industry component
    also matters (King, [1966](#CR18)), and the specific component of the stock returns,
    i.e. the part that does not depend on the market or the industry, is even more
    important (Roll, [1988](#CR23)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like the market returns, the industry returns have also been shown to be
    predictable, for example by exploiting the momentum anomaly, which states that
    past high (low) industry returns are followed by future high (low) industry returns
    (O’Neal, [2000](#CR20)). Since there are several industries, it is also possible
    to predict industry returns in a cross-sectional fashion, using industry characteristics
    (Asness et al., [2000](#CR3)). In this paper, Asness also demonstrates that it
    is possible to perform cross-sectional predictions of specific returns, however,
    most of the papers dedicated to the cross-section of stock returns do not control
    for industry exposures.

- en: The most important milestone in this literature may be the seminal paper of
    Fama and French ([1993](#CR10)), which introduces a three-factor linear model
    to explain the cross-section of stock returns. This model was completed in 2015
    by the same two authors (Fama & French, [2015](#CR11)), leading to a five-factor
    model that takes into account the beta of the firm (its sensitivity to the market
    returns), its size (the market capitalization), a value factor (the book to market
    ratio), its (operating) profitability and its investment pattern (aggressive versus
    conservative investment behavior of the firm). Although it is not included in
    the model, the momentum anomaly is also an important explanatory factor of the
    cross-section of stock returns (see Carhart, [1997](#CR7); Jegadeesh & Titman,
    [1993](#CR15)).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This approach of describing the cross-section of stock returns by a linear multi-factor
    model has been extended so much that there are now dozens to hundreds of factors
    recognized by the literature (see, for example, Green et al. ([2014](#CR12)) and
    Hou et al. ([2017](#CR14)) for an assessment of the reliability of the different
    factors). It also shaped the asset management industry, in which the so-called
    “risk premia”^([3](#Fn3)) funds tend to emerge as a new asset class, investing
    in a passive manner into these factors (Bender et al., [2014](#CR5)). What used
    to be called “alpha”, in the sense of Jensen ([1968](#CR16)), is now simply considered
    as risk factors, making these strategies comparable to “beta” investing, i.e.
    passive investing in the market. Following the approach of predicting (“timing”)
    the market, a literature finally emerged on the question of timing the returns
    of the risk factors (see Bender et al., [2018](#CR6); Asness et al., [2017](#CR1)).

    above all aim to produce expectations about the future stock returns. However,
    to the best of our knowledge at the time of writing, a single framework that combines
    all these kinds of predictions does not exist in the literature. We propose such
    a simple, descriptive model below. Note that that the goal of the model is efficiency.
    It does not aim to propose an economic explanation of the stock returns.

    be explained (respectively) by the cross-sections of industry and firm characteristics
    (size, value, quality, etc). Following Fama and French ([1993](#CR10), [2015](#CR11)),
    for each characteristic we can form a portfolio, so that the stock returns are
    expressed as a function of the factors’ portfolio returns.

- en: For example, we can create a portfolio that invests in the momentum anomaly.
    This portfolio, if constructed long/short, would be long the past winners and
    short the past losers, and to some extent may neutralize the exposure to the market
    returns. Hereafter we refer to the returns of this momentum factor portfolio as
    “*r*[*mom*]”. Note that the portfolio can be constructed with the same stocks
    in order to invest on the cross-section of industry or specific returns only.
    Indeed, we can neutralize the industry exposure of a portfolio, or its specific
    exposure by an appropriate long/short construction (see Asness et al., [2014](#CR2))
    for an example of such a portfolio construction). Hence, we adopt the name “*r*[*mom,I*]”
    for the returns of the portfolio which invests in the momentum anomaly through
    the cross-section of industries while being neutralized at the specific level.
    Similarly, “*r*[*mom,S*]” designates the returns of the portfolio which invests
    in the momentum anomaly through the cross-section of specific returns while being
    neutralized at the industry level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, there are numerous anomalies identified in the literature, both at
    the industry and specific level. We define the industry and specific sets of *all*
    the relevant factors (known and unknown) as follows:![$$ {\mathcal{F}}_I=\left\{{r}_{mom,I},{r}_{size,I},{r}_{value,I},{r}_{quality,I},\dots
    \right\}, $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equa.png)![$$

    \right\}. $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ2.png)(1.2)Assuming
    that these factors are able to completely describe the industry and firm characteristics,
    we can put![$$ {r}_I={\eta}_I\left({\mathcal{F}}_I\right) $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ3.png)(1.3)and![$$
    {r}_S={\eta}_S\left({\mathcal{F}}_S\right), $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ4.png)(1.4)in

    and ![$$ {\mathcal{F}}_{\mathrm{S}} $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_IEq2.png)
    are combined using their associated functions *η*[*I*] and *η*[*S*] to form the
    industry and specific returns. Substituting these into Eq. ([1.1](#Equ1)) leads
    to![$$ {r}_a={\omega}_a\left({r}_M,{\eta}_I\left({\mathcal{F}}_I\right),{\eta}_S\left({\mathcal{F}}_S\right)\right).
    $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ5.png)(1.5)Note
    that if we represent each stock return as a combination of the returns of several
    factor portfolios, we can also represent a portfolio “*P*”, composed of a total
    number of *b* stocks, as a combination of the factor portfolios. Hence, the returns
    of such a portfolio would be:![$$ {r}_P=\sum \limits_{a=1}^b{\omega}_a\left({r}_M,{\eta}_I\left({\mathcal{F}}_I\right),{\eta}_S\left({\mathcal{F}}_S\right)\right)\times
    {w}_a, $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ6.png)(1.6)in
    which *w*[*a*] is the weight of the stock “*a*” in the portfolio. The weighted
    sum of individual combination functions ω[a] being just a veil, masking that we
    ultimately invest in factor portfolios, we may reformulate the portfolio’s returns
    as follows:![$$ {r}_P={\varOmega}_P\left({r}_M,{\mathcal{F}}_I,{\mathcal{F}}_S\right),
    $$](../images/519851_1_En_1_Chapter/519851_1_En_1_Chapter_TeX_Equ7.png)(1.7)where
    *Ω*[*P*] is the combination function of sub-portfolios used to construct the portfolio
    *P*. An appropriate definition of *Ω*[*P*] would reflect to some extent the weighting
    (potentially non-linear) among factors that are captured by the combination functions
    *ω*[*a*], *η*[*I*] and *η*[*S*].

    statically exposed to the returns of the different factors. Maximizing *r*[*p*]
    would require a dynamic adjustment of the exposures according to some criterion
    in order to benefit from timing the factor performances. For example, we should
    go short the market portfolio if we have information from a market-timing strategy
    that the market is about to enter into a bearish period. The combination function,
    properly defined, would thus be able to identify the proper proportions of the
    factor portfolios as well as to time their performances.
