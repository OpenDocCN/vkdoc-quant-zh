    of analyses and discussions. However, we often remain ambiguous in this regard.
    It may be helpful to read the World Economic Forum''s so-called white paper, Resetting
    the Future of Work Agenda in a Post-Covid World, to understand what theorists
    of this epochal maneuver are aiming for. This 31-page document describes how to
    run (or, as they say these days, implement) the software included in the CoViD-19
    book. World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab and Thierry Malleret co-wrote
    The Great Reset (Schwab and Malleret in COVID-19: The Big Reset, [2020](#CR1);
    Umbrello in The Journal Value Inquiry:1–8, [2021](#CR2); Roth in European Management
    Journal 39.5:538–544, [2021](#CR3)). Why devote an entire chapter to this topic
    in a book about AI and its applications in finance? It’s simple: updating the
    financial world to make it safer, more understandable, and more manageable necessitates
    extensive use of AI technologies. These technologies can be harmful up to a point.'

    unemployment benefits since mid-March, with new weekly claims far exceeding historic

    steer the market toward more equitable outcomes. Governments should improve coordination
    (for example, in tax, regulatory, and fiscal policy), upgrade trade agreements,
    and create the conditions for a “stakeholder economy” to achieve this goal. Governments
    have a strong incentive to pursue such action in an era of shrinking tax bases
    and soaring public debt.

    more equitable outcomes. These may include changes to wealth taxes, the elimination
    of fossil-fuel subsidies, and new rules governing intellectual property, trade,
    and competition, depending on the country.

    advance common goals like equality and sustainability. The large-scale spending
    programs that many governments are implementing represent a significant opportunity
    for progress in this area. The European Commission, for example, has proposed
    a €750 billion ($826 billion) recovery fund. The United States, China, and Japan
    all have aggressive economic stimulus plans.

    pension funds, to patch up the old system, we should use them to build a new one
    that is more resilient, equitable, and long-term sustainable. This includes, for
    example, the construction of “green” urban infrastructure and the creation of
    incentives for industries to improve their performance on environmental, social,
    and governance (ESG) metrics.

    Revolution innovations to benefit the public good, particularly by addressing

    during the COVID-19 crisis to develop diagnostics, therapeutics, and possible
    vaccines; establish testing centers; develop mechanisms for tracing infections;
    and provide telemedicine. Consider what could be accomplished if similar coordinated

    some industry leaders and senior executives may be tempted to equate recovery
    with reboot, hoping to return to the old normal and restore what worked in the
    past: traditions, tried and true procedures, and familiar ways of doing things—in
    short, a return to business as usual. This will not occur because it cannot occur.
    In most cases, “business as usual” has died (or been infected with) COVID-19\.
    Economic hibernation caused by blockades and social distancing measures has devastated
    some sectors. Others will struggle to recoup lost revenue before embarking on
    an increasingly narrow path to profitability as a result of the global economic

    key question will be striking the right balance between what worked in the past

    to pre-pandemic conditions is unthinkable in the near future (and perhaps never
    in some cases …). Others, particularly in manufacturing and food, are more concerned
    with adapting to the shock and leveraging new trends (such as digital) to thrive
    in the post-pandemic era. Size makes a difference as well. Small businesses face

- en: The buzzword of “digital transformation” was the mantra of most executive boards
    and committees prior to the pandemic. Digital was “critical,” it had to be implemented
    “decisively,” and it was regarded as a “prerequisite for success”! Since then,
    the mantra has become a must, even in the case of some businesses, a matter of
    life and death. This is simple to explain and comprehend. During our incarceration,
    we were completely reliant on the Internet for everything, from work and education
    to socializing. It is online services that have allowed us to maintain a semblance
    of normalcy, and it is natural that “online” has benefited the most from the pandemic,
    providing a huge boost to technologies and processes that allow us to do things
    remotely, such as universal Internet to broadband, mobile and remote payments,
    and viable e-government services, among others. As a result, businesses that already
    operate online will have a long-term competitive advantage. Businesses in industries
    as diverse as e-commerce, contactless operations, digital content, robots, and
    drone deliveries (to name a few) will thrive as more and more things and services
    are delivered to us via our cell phones and computers. It is no coincidence that
    companies such as Alibaba, Amazon, Netflix, and Zoom have emerged as “winners”
    as a result of the lockdown.

    required contactless experience imposed on many food and retail businesses during
    lockdowns to virtual showrooms in the manufacturing industry that allow customers

    have quickly recognized the need to provide their customers with a digital journey
    “from start to finish.”

    of these different activities, such as equipment maintenance, inventory management,
    supplier relationships, and security strategies, can now be performed (to a large
    extent) by a computer. The Internet of Things provides businesses with the ability
    to not only execute and comply with social distancing rules, but also to reduce

    shortening have been ongoing for years. They are often intricate and difficult
    to manage. They are also difficult to monitor in terms of environmental and labor
    law compliance, potentially exposing companies to reputational risks and brand
    damage. In light of this troubled history, the pandemic has put the final nail
    in the coffin of the principle that companies should optimize supply chains based
    on the cost of individual components and on a single source of supply for critical
    materials. In the post-pandemic era, “end-to-end value optimization”—a concept
    that includes resilience, efficiency, and cost—will be dominant. The formula states
    that “just-in-case” will eventually replace “just-in-time.”
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The shocks to global supply chains discussed in the macro section will affect
    both large and small businesses. But, in practice, what does “just in case” mean?
    The globalization model conceived and built at the end of the last century by
    global manufacturing companies in search of low-cost labor, products, and components
    has reached its limits. It has fragmented international production into ever more
    intricate fragments, resulting in a system managed on an intimate scale that has
    proven extremely lean and efficient, but also extremely complex and, as a result,
    extremely vulnerable (complexity brings fragility and often provokes instability).
    As a result, simplification is the antidote, which should result in increased
    resilience. As a result, the “global value chains,” which account for roughly
    three-quarters of all global trade, will inevitably decline. This decline will
    be exacerbated by the new reality that companies that rely on complex just-in-time
    supply chains can no longer assume that the World Trade Organization's tariff
    commitments will protect them from a sudden wave of protectionism from somewhere
    part.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'As a result, they will be forced to prepare for a prolonged outage by reducing
    or localizing their supply chain and devising alternative production or supply
    plans. Any business whose profitability is dependent on the just-in-time global
    supply chain principle will have to rethink how it operates and will almost certainly
    have to sacrifice the idea of maximizing efficiency and profits for the sake of
    “supply security” and resilience. Resilience will then become the primary consideration
    for any business serious about protecting itself from disruption, whether that
    disruption is caused by a specific supplier, a potential change in trade policy,
    or a specific country or region. In practice, this will force businesses to diversify
    their supplier base, even at the expense of stockpiling and creating redundancy.
    It will also compel these companies to ensure that the same is true within their
    own supply chain: they will assess resilience throughout the entire supply chain,
    all the way down to their final supplier and possibly even their supplier’s suppliers.
    Costs of production will inevitably rise, but this will be the cost of building
    resilience. At first glance, the automotive, electronics, and industrial machinery
    sectors will be the most affected because they will be the first to change production
    models.'
