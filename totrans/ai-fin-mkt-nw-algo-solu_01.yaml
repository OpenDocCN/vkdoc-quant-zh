- en: 'Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science concerned with the
    development of intelligent machines that function and behave similarly to humans.
    A.I. is based on the notion that a machine can simulate the human brain and that,
    given enough data, a machine can learn to think and act like a human. As a result,
    we can apply artificial intelligence to financial markets and predict future trends,
    for example. A machine can also be trained to recognize patterns in buyer dynamics
    and then use this knowledge to forecast future prices. I could go on and on, but
    the main point is: why is AI useful in the context of credit markets? What are
    the advantages of applying artificial intelligence to finance? In brief, this
    book is dedicated to explaining this: Improved accuracy: AI can aid in the prediction
    of closing prices, opening prices, and other financial data. This can lead to
    better decisions and more profitable trades. Improved service: Artificial intelligence
    can be used to improve customer service in financial institutions. It can, for
    example, be used to assist customers with account inquiries or to provide a technical
    analysis of the market. Reduced costs: AI can assist in lowering the costs of
    running a financial institution. It can be used to automate processes or improve
    operational efficiency, for example.'

    It is expanding in assisted (or autonomous) driving solutions, computer vision,
    automatic text analysis, chat-bot creation, economic planning applications, and
    marketing support platforms. But how much of this growth is being reinvested profitably
    in the financial markets? How much AI can we currently see in the capital market,
    and, more importantly, how much can we expect to see in the near future? What
    are the challenges? What technologies are you using?

- en: To begin answering these questions, let us define AI today. Artificial intelligence
    is still a long way from creating an intelligent mind. Indeed, there are numerous
    indications that this is no longer a hot topic. On the contrary, we are far ahead
    in the field of so-called restricted artificial intelligence, which, when applied
    to very specific contexts, ensures excellent results that are superior to human
    skills and abilities. We must not believe that a commercial chat-bot (such as
    SIRI) was created to mimic human intelligence and perhaps better understand human
    cognitive processes. In fact, this ambition, to create a positive feedback loop
    between understanding the mind, artificial mind realizations, and a new understanding
    of the mind, does not appear to be on the agenda in either basic research or applications.
    SIRI is an example of access to distributed databases that uses natural language
    as an interface, and it has far more in common with traditional IT than with the
    theory of cognitive systems for searching for information, such as short term
    memory structures in the human mind.

    with mind and AI in an integrated manner, frequently linking the functioning of
    the mind to the fact that the mind is connected to a brain and a body in nature.
    Cognitive models of multisensory integration in humans have been developed and
    applied to model human body experience over the last few decades. Recent research
    indicates that Bayesian and connectionist models may drive developments in various
    branches of robotics: assistive robotic devices may adapt to their human users,
    e.g., in prosthetics, and humanoid robots may be endowed with human-like capabilities
    regarding their surrounding space, such as keeping safe or socially appropriate
    distances from other agents. However, we expect to see AI outside of laboratories
    beyond the time horizon set by this book (ten years).'

    and learn differently than humans, we can now develop systems capable of performing
    actions and tasks efficiently and effectively (think of the difference with which
    they learn to recognize a cat a child rather than a computer vision system). However,
    it is undeniable that in certain areas and with specific tasks, systems utilizing
    artificial intelligence techniques can produce results that are superior to those
    of humans.

    we currently expect to find, which we believe will be discovered soon, and which

    since our species has been able to generate a “surplus” of resources that can
    be conserved and possibly exchanged. In fact, it makes no sense to try to assign
    a value to things in hunter-gatherer societies, such as the Native American populations
    of the north, because the things themselves, whatever they are, are used now and

    is made to assign value to financial assets that are sometimes very distant from
    the ‘physical’ good that produced them. Let's start with mortgages. Even if we
    ignore any financially complex mortgage transaction (for example, the consolidation
    of multiple mortgages into a single object on which to borrow money), a mortgage
    is a loan that I make using the value of a physical asset as collateral (l property)
    that follows value dynamics that are very different from the dynamics of the loan
    financial object. The property's value may increase or decrease depending on structural
    changes in the environment in which it is rented (a new metro stop has opened
    in my neighborhood), whereas the mortgage is influenced, for example, by macroeconomic
    dynamics linked to interest rates (the bank has less interest in providing mortgages
    because interest rates tend to be low).

    financial one linked to the mortgage as a financial object in the strict sense,
    and the property understood as a physical asset in the strict sense: for example,
    if macroeconomic dynamics push interest rates lower, and banks pay less, the value
    of a house can fall, because demand falls (many people do not have enough money
    to buy and, given the difficulty in obtaining mortgag-es, they give up).'

    “technology,” was coined in 2014 in the United Kingdom and refers to solutions,
    technologies, and tools for the innovation of processes, products, services, and
    the real estate market. Proptech refers to all of the digital solutions that are
    revolutionizing various aspects of real estate, such as real estate sales, risk
    analysis, and financial forecasting models, asset management, and the financing
    dynamics of development projects. Proptech is, in fact, a minor component of the
    larger digital transformation of the real estate industry. It is associated with
    a shift in mindset in the real estate industry and its users regarding technological
    innovation in data collection, transactions, and building and city design. But
    there's more to it than just the sale. According to some studies, the demand for
    rental housing units is rapidly increasing, to the point where we refer to “rent

    to automate repetitive routine tasks that are not stimulating for journalists.
