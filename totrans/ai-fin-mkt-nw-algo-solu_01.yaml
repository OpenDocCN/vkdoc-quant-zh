  zh: 摘要
- en: 'Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science concerned with the
    development of intelligent machines that function and behave similarly to humans.
    A.I. is based on the notion that a machine can simulate the human brain and that,
    given enough data, a machine can learn to think and act like a human. As a result,
    we can apply artificial intelligence to financial markets and predict future trends,
    for example. A machine can also be trained to recognize patterns in buyer dynamics
    and then use this knowledge to forecast future prices. I could go on and on, but
    the main point is: why is AI useful in the context of credit markets? What are
    the advantages of applying artificial intelligence to finance? In brief, this
    book is dedicated to explaining this: Improved accuracy: AI can aid in the prediction
    of closing prices, opening prices, and other financial data. This can lead to
    better decisions and more profitable trades. Improved service: Artificial intelligence
    can be used to improve customer service in financial institutions. It can, for
    example, be used to assist customers with account inquiries or to provide a technical
    analysis of the market. Reduced costs: AI can assist in lowering the costs of
    running a financial institution. It can be used to automate processes or improve
    operational efficiency, for example.'

- en: To begin answering these questions, let us define AI today. Artificial intelligence
    is still a long way from creating an intelligent mind. Indeed, there are numerous
    indications that this is no longer a hot topic. On the contrary, we are far ahead
    in the field of so-called restricted artificial intelligence, which, when applied
    to very specific contexts, ensures excellent results that are superior to human
    skills and abilities. We must not believe that a commercial chat-bot (such as
    SIRI) was created to mimic human intelligence and perhaps better understand human
    cognitive processes. In fact, this ambition, to create a positive feedback loop
    between understanding the mind, artificial mind realizations, and a new understanding
    of the mind, does not appear to be on the agenda in either basic research or applications.
    SIRI is an example of access to distributed databases that uses natural language
    as an interface, and it has far more in common with traditional IT than with the
    theory of cognitive systems for searching for information, such as short term
    memory structures in the human mind.

    Cognitive models of multisensory integration in humans have been developed and
    applied to model human body experience over the last few decades. Recent research
    indicates that Bayesian and connectionist models may drive developments in various
    branches of robotics: assistive robotic devices may adapt to their human users,
    e.g., in prosthetics, and humanoid robots may be endowed with human-like capabilities

    a value to things in hunter-gatherer societies, such as the Native American populations

- en: Capital markets are the most advanced form of this process because an attempt
    is made to assign value to financial assets that are sometimes very distant from
    the ‘physical’ good that produced them. Let's start with mortgages. Even if we
    ignore any financially complex mortgage transaction (for example, the consolidation
    of multiple mortgages into a single object on which to borrow money), a mortgage
    is a loan that I make using the value of a physical asset as collateral (l property)
    that follows value dynamics that are very different from the dynamics of the loan
    financial object. The property's value may increase or decrease depending on structural
    changes in the environment in which it is rented (a new metro stop has opened
    in my neighborhood), whereas the mortgage is influenced, for example, by macroeconomic
    dynamics linked to interest rates (the bank has less interest in providing mortgages

- en: 'After all, there are dozens of circularities that connect the two values, the
    financial one linked to the mortgage as a financial object in the strict sense,
    and the property understood as a physical asset in the strict sense: for example,
    if macroeconomic dynamics push interest rates lower, and banks pay less, the value
