- en: In an Asimov novel he imagines that ‘machines’ can receive input from all the
    ‘facts’ that happen in the world, day after day, year after year. Machines are
    robots in the *Asimovian* sense, and therefore they cannot let their action (or
    inaction) harm human beings in any way, furthermore they must obey humans and
    only ultimately protect themselves. And so day after day, year after year, they
    suggest lines of action, modify procedures, ask for the creation of structures
    and modify others. In order to promote the welfare of the human race. Without
    revealing how the story ends (it ends in a very fascinating way anyway), **FuturICT
    2.0, a 2019 EU initiative** proposes exactly this, namely the creation of decision-making
    aid tools, which receive data from the world and propose explanations for dynamics,
    lines of action, solutions. In this Chap. 1 describe what FuturICT is now, and
    how this dream hides within it a challenge that is difficult to fully grasp.

    amount of data by employing mathematics and statistics. And many different techniques
    are employed to achieve this as good research leads to better results which lead
    to a profit for the financial institutions. Data science has become extremely
    relevant in the financial sector, which is mainly used for risk management and
    risk analysis. Companies also evaluate data models using business intelligence
    software.

    and frauds has increased. This has helped reduce risk and scams, mitigate losses

    methods, processes, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge rod insights
    from a lot of structural and unstructured data. Data science is related to data
    mining, machine learning and big data. Simply put, data science is the collection
    of data obtained from structured and unstructured sources so as to extract valuable
    insights. Data sources may include online or manual surveys, retail customer data,
    and social media usage information and actions. This data is used to model the
    actions of a network or customer base to predict future behavior and patterns.
    This research can be extended to a specific sample community, such as retail customers
    or consumers of social media, weather forecasting, machine learning, and a wide
    variety of other disciplines.

    problem. Such circumstances create cognitive dissonance, i.e., an uncomfortable
    feeling of inconsistency. Some researchers propose an innovative way to tackle

    of tokens, our design leverages the innovative capacity of independent token proposals.
    Every token idea is welcome, but acceptance as an official FIN4 token requires
    users to vote for it with their governance (GOV) tokens. Thus, all users co-maintain

    action token holdings, which could otherwise introduce bias to the reputation
    system.

    that support and strengthen the entire FIN4 system. As a minimum, the actions
    suitable for obtaining these reputation tokens include (1) the active gathering
    of tokens (low reward), (2) participation in proof mechanisms (medium reward)
    and (3) the acceptance of token designs by curators (high reward). Finally, users
    should also be able to lose these reputation tokens. Also, how can we incentivize
    entire communities that may already have their own tokens established to join
    the larger ecosystem? The idea is to represent the additional liquidity won when
    joining the larger FIN4 network through a “reserve currency” we call liquidity
    token (LIQ). This token would stand for the network effects gained when enabling
    larger networks and markets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One conceivable, yet too simplistic approach would be to create the same number
    of FIN4 tokens for each accepted token proposal. The overall number of liquidity
    tokens would, therefore, be commensurate with the total number of FIN4 tokens
    in the system, thereby giving users more trust in using the different tokens and
    some assurance that tokens can be exchanged with one another. This could be based
    on the original idea of “Bancor” by John Maynard Keynes; however, the final design
    has not yet been decided. Due to the nature of blockchain technology, blockchain
    creators are unable to prevent trades beyond the confines of the system. Our approach
    is to create strong incentives to use the platform, while preserving the freedom
    of users to leave at any time and take their token balances with them. Furthermore,
    a form of identity is needed when users wish to participate in the governance
    of FIN4\. Identity (ID) here corresponds less to the idea of a scanned passport
    and more to a concept of self-sovereignty built entirely within the FIN4 system
    or transferred from other platforms. For example, reputation mechanims may establish
    identity over time.

    makes understanding them extremely difficult. Furthermore, any provisional understanding
    we obtain is frequently surpassed by quick change and new innovations, making
    social and political responses challenging. Information and communication technology
    (ICT), which has created new tools for social exchange, has been a major driver
    of change (e.g., social media, social network sites). Political decision-makers,
    on the other hand, frequently struggle to keep up with new media developments
    and to understand their dynamics and impact on society and its many institutions,
    such as the family, schools and universities, political parties, banks, business
    organizations, or financial markets. This stems not only from the reality that
    uneducated and incorrect public policy responses to challenges such as terrorism,
    food safety, infectious disease outbreaks, financial crises, or environmental
    disasters kill many persons and incur tremendous financial expenses. It is also
    necessary to maintain voters' trust and confidence in governments, as poor policies
    can swiftly erode government legitimacy. World leaders are perplexed by the role
    of new media in political revolutions like the Arab Spring, social disturbances
    like the London riots, and terrorist networks. Nonetheless, stakeholders affected
    by such interventions held decision makers accountable depending on the extent
    to which they endeavored to make available the best and most comprehensive data
    and applied the best and most applicable models and theories to make sense of
    the facts. This is founded on the regulative ideal that we should avoid intervening
    in a system that we do not fully understand and cannot foresee how it will respond
    to our interventions. As long as this regulative ideal continues, the current
    situation necessitates a greater understanding of society.

    the dissemination of this knowledge to decision-makers and players in the actual
